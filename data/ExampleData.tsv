post_2560044	post_2559436	"Read the MMR and autism post.    It was posted a long while back	 but someone did a reply relatively recently.    Anyways	 the latest reply from twinmommyplusone was really good.    She has a 5 year old with autism	 and basically talks about why she feels that it is not related any more since the mercury has been removed.    Maybe I'm not remembering correctly.    I think she said she noticed signs since her son's birth.    I also noticed signs my daughter showed since her birth	 long before the MMR which also didn't have mercury.    So	 who knows.    I've heard that there is a study now that's investigating whether early sonograms might contribute.    Of course no results yet	 it will be several years probably	 but I guess some scientists are curious enough to investigate it."	0

post_2565830	post_2559436	"There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to link the the MMR vaccine with autism.There is	 however	 ample evidence of the danger of measles. Before the vaccine	 measles used to kill 450 children per year and disable 1000 more. My grandmother's sister was among the disabled	 she was blinded by the disease.This weeks MMWR contains an article about a measles outbreak in San Diego. The parents took an unvaccinated child to Switzerland	 where he got the disease. The child then went to school	 and to the doctors	 infecting 11 additional children.The health authorities had to trace every contact. Unvaccinated children had to undergo a 21 day quarantine. It is a very heavy price for a trip for Europe."	0
post_2584859	post_2559436	"Safe to say swampcritter doesn't have a child with autism. I have two. The week my daughter got her MMR she started saying ""daddy"" the day after the vaccination it went away and never came back. You are going to have to do better than antiquated fatality statistics to convince me that in 2008 measles is worse than autism. A 21 day quarantine beats the he** out of a lifetime with autism."	1
post_2585810	post_2559436	Is measles a probem in Switzerland?    Do they imunize their children in Switzerland?    I am surprized that this child contracted measles in Switzerland.    I asm also surprized that 11 children plus the child in question    were not imunized in a San Diego school.    I guess parents can opt out but i am surprized that as many as 12 had done so in one individual school.	0
post_2617507	post_2559436	"The Center of Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics have both concluded that there is no link between the vaccine and autism.    Thimerisol (mercury component) in the vaccines has been removed from the MMR since 1999.    If there was a link	 wouldn't the incidence of autism decrease?"	0
post_2618283	post_2559436	"IMHO	 the incidence of autism has increased due to the changing DSM definition of autism has broadened over the years    and IDEA definition of autism was added within the last 20 years.    Once IDEA added autism as a category	 as lot of kids labeled with autism flooded the rosters.     Also	 more professionals know    what to look for in patients who have been misdiagnosed in the past.Just an example here:No one over 40 has    fetal alcohol syndrome	     It affects about 1 in 500 kids today. Fetal alcohol syndrome was not even recognized until the mid-'70s. Fetal alcohol syndrome still existed;    no one would say alcoholism among pregnant women just started in the 70's."	0
post_2638137	post_2559436	"Since geneticists now feel that autism is likely triggered by something envirnmental 	 I do not think vaccines can be 100% ruled out as a TRIGGER.I wouldn't call it the one and only cause though.I think they are likely numerous environmental triggers including the illnesses the vaccines protect our children from.One neuro has a theory that noise pollution is a trigger. Very interesting."	1
post_2652656	post_2559436	"One can go by theories or actual science.    Most of the authors of the study that claimed that thimerisol (the agent in the MMR vaccine that was supposedly linked to autism) have since come out publicly and said they were incorrect.    Thimerisol has been OUT OF THE SHOTS SINCE 1999!    If it was the thimerisol causes autism	 wouldn't the rate of autism have gone down since it had been removed from the shot?    I am not saying that it couldn't be a combination between genetics and enviromental factors but the shot theory just doesn't follow logic.    A friend of mine has twins	 one autistic and one not.    They both got the MMR vaccine on the SAME DAY from the SAME BATCH.    If it were the shot that causes autism	 wouldn't both of those children have it?"	0
post_2652793	post_2559436	"Not to get off topic or anything but I was reading one person's blog on talentdatabase who thinks there is a link between baby shampoos and autism. I'm not sure if the blogger is autistic or not	 but she seems to be interested in it. She suggested googling up autism and phthalates.I'm not saying if it is true or not	 but it was interesting to read nonetheless. I've also read connections between anorexia and autism. Even chimeras and autism!Personally I think there are a number of factors that cause autism whether it is biological or environmental.(I_  m straining for a good visual example)    Say you want to cook a casserole dish. There are several different recipes for the same thing. It_  s still potatoes and green beans	 but the method of cooking and preparation may have been different.Or you cut your finger. Several things may have caused the cut.That_  s my take on the whole causes of autism debate_  À_    I think rather than try to figure out a single _  cause_   just focus on what you have at hand	 your son	 or daughter.    No matter what caused the autism	 you have an autistic child. Autism doesn_  t have to be a death sentence. (some parents seem to think) There are pros and cons.    If you think of it there_  s _  type A_   personality	 whether that_  s a real dx or not is a debate. It is not quite viewed as a disability	 but it too has its up-sides and downsides.Long term wise if there are environmental triggers that are causing damage to people	 I hope that with research	 that those chemicals can be pulled off the market	 and taken o"	1
post_2688331	post_2559436	"Some facts I dug up which may raise more questions1.Mercury in routine children's vaccines has not been present in Canada since at least 1990.    The rates of autism in those children born after 1990 in Canada have increased2. There have been studies in Britain and Denmark    showing that over the past ten to fifteen years in those nations where mercury was taken out of vaccines	 autism rates have increasedOTOH3.    mercury is a known and proven neurotoxin; thimerosal contains mercury; thimerosal is present in vaccines.4.Thimerisiol was never tested for toxicity	 despite the many years (about 50) of public concern.so...letsee....

post_2161040	post_2160045	"I'm no expert	 but I had this delima when I needed to get my kids vaccinated.    What I decided in the end was that the potential side effects of the vaccines were less sever then the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.    Another point	 with the autism link	 is that autism doesn't show up in children until they reach 18-24months	 which is the age they are when they get the vaccine in question.    Therefore	 it is believed that the link is just a conicidence and there is no real proof that it is caused from the vaccine. They have also found that just as many kids get autism that have not been vaccinated as those that have.    I hope this helps."	0
post_2161965	post_2160045	"I agree with jlaszlo.    For me	 there was never any question about whether or not to get the vaccines for my children.    The risk of dealing with ""what they could get without the vaccines"" verses the risks of ""the side effects getting the vaccines"" was a chance I was willing to take.    I live in a very diverse and transient area with many people from other countries coming and going out of the US every day.    The immunization rules and regulations are not nearly as strict in other countries as in the US.    Many other countries are still dealing with many diseases that the US eradicated 20 or 30 years ago due to our immunization program.    With my children attending school in such a diverse area	 you better believe that keeping them up-to-date on their immunizations is one of the first things at each of their well-child check-ups."	0
post_2908208	post_2907547	"I have heard of side effects from Gardisil. There was a show on t.v. about it one night. It was a while ago that I saw it so I don't remember it very well	 but it was about the dangers of Gardisil and about all the girls who have serious side effects. The show was saying the side effects were pretty bad in a lot of girls. I remember them saying a lot of them were having episodes of passing out and all sorts of other things that don't happen with other immunizations. There are other people in the medical community that argued the benefits of the drug and that most girls were doing fine. I'm sorry I can't be more exact with the details. You need to look this up	 or have someone look this up for you if you aren't feeling well. I am going to researchi this also and see what I can come up with and I'll get back to you. This is really upsetting to here you are having these symptoms. I'm not sure these shots are safe and I worry that unsuspecting young woman may be doing themselves more bad than good getting them. I am not sure how it all weighs out. For something bad to happen to even one girl from this should be a good enough reason for them to stop using it until they can figure out how to make something that won't hurt you or atleast make sure you are completely aware of the fact that it can hurt you before they give it to you.. Right now	 I don't think girls are really getting enough information about this before they get it. I think it's being presented to them as no big deal	 and with any sort of drug that they themselves don't even understand	 is going to be a big deal and a big decision. We don't want our young woman being experimented on while they are figuring it out."	0
post_2908243	post_2907547	"This is a little clipping from the info I found:Since its approval	 there have been at least 3	461 complaints of adverse reactions to the Gardasil vaccine	 and there could have been as many as eight deaths attributable to Gardasil. According to Judicial Watch	 in several instances	 blood clots were reported to have occurred after the administration of Gardasil.Other side effects including paralysis	 Bells Palsy	 Guillain-Barre Syndrome	 and seizures were also reported.    Our Gardasil side effect attorneys believe that even these Gardasil adverse event reports could be underestimating the true number of serious Gardisil side effect incidents that have actually occurred.    For that reason	 we are seeking to speak with anyone who experienced serious Gardasil side effects.Gardasil has also been linked to an increased instance of fainting following administration of the vaccine. From 2002-2004 there were a total of about 50 reports of vaccine-related fainting.    But from    2005 until last July	 reports of vaccine-related fainting spiked to about 230. About 180 of those cases followed a shot of Gardasil	 according to the    CDC).The Gardasil side effect    reports also include 28 women who miscarried after receiving Gardasil.    In May 2007	 a 24-year-old woman suffered a miscarriage	 which an investigator in a report issued to the federal government said	 _  may have been caused by Gardasil because the patient received the injection within 30 days of the pregnancy._   In July 2007	 a 17-year-old girl from Texas was unaware she was pregnant when she got her second dose of Gardasil. She miscarried	 but the cause of the miscarriage hasn_  t been determined	 according to a report.The reasons for two other miscarriages    in Florida in 2007 - one by a 16-year-old and another by a 24-year-old both - are undetermined	 according to reports. But it is known that both women had Gardasil vaccinations shortly before the miscarriages.    If you or someone you know suffered a miscarriage following the administration of Gardasil	 it is important that you contact one of our Gardasil side effect lawyers in order to protect your rights.Most disturbing among the Gardasil side effect reports are those that involve the deaths of young women.    Three young women in the US died shortly after receiving Gardasil	 while two other women in Europe also died after the vaccine was administered.    Despite all of these reports	 Merck continues to market Gardasil as virtually side-effect free. Our Gardasil side effect lawyers believe that Merck has misled the public about Gardasil's potential dangers	 and our law firm intends to hold Merck accountable for these dangerous Gardasil side effects.Legal Help for Gardasil Side Effect VictimsIf you or someone you know suffered a serious Gardasil side effect	 you have valuable legal rights.

post_2910788	post_2907547	"No	 I'm too old to have gotten it. I wouldn't be too trusting in what your doctors have to say. There are a lot of reasons why they wouldn't want you to be having a reaction to this drug. They could call it something else instead. Possibly they will be on your side with this	 but you can never be sure. Please call a lawyer right away. It would be one phone call	 it could turn out to be the most important thing you ever did	 and it could even turn out that you will end up saving lives because of that call. This is a very serious tragedy happening to our youth brought on by a drug company looking for patients to sell a cure. The truth is you might have never been at risk of getting HPV. If you are not with more than one partner you run a very slim chance of ever getting it. With each additional partner your chance of getting it goes up. If you ue condoms	 you're good. This is what we should be doing for our daughters. Telling them the facts. Get regular pap's. Use condoms. There are many things we can do	 but we don't need an immunization forced on us just simply assuming we are all going to need it. There is something seriously wrong with that idiology. We as woman	 we must fight this with all we have. It is a total insult that they have made it a law that all young woman have these shots. HPV is not something that spreads to everyone like the other childhood illnesses we use immunizations to treat. This is something that is we can control on our own. It's obvious this was brought into being by people who don't understand that we can control ourselves. I could see if this drug wasn't causing problems	 but medical science just hasn't come far enough to understand what the long term effects of any drug really are. Don't be fooled by fancy talk. Your doctors are mostly doing a hole lot of guessing."	0
post_2911259	post_2907547	Just my two cents.. Many of these arguments echo concerns we had when the polio and small pox vaccines were mandatory. There were    many that had these same side effects...

post_3665101	post_3665075	"Hi Steve	Titanium allergies are rare	 may be because people rarely come in contact with this metal on a regular basis; except for people who have them as implants. However it is unwise to jump to a conclusion that Titanium is the allergen without proper investigation. The first step would be to attempt to determine if any drugs that one is taking are causing this. Hypersensitivity reactions to titanium have been reported to be a cause of implant failure in hip replacement surgery and for spine (vertebral) stabilization.    Skin patch testing for metal hypersensitivity was strongly positive for titanium and nickel	 supporting the role of the titanium bioprosthesis in the development of DRESS syndrome.    In some instances of titanium reactions	 it has been necessary to remove the prosthesis.    This is a serious decision and any consideration of it should include consultation with an allergist/immunologist.    People who have had an allergic reaction to a metallic device or jewelry are more likely to have a reaction to an implanted device than those with no history.Also Titanium causing and a seizure is even more rare. So I recommend a visit to a allergist/immunologist and have it evaluated.If you have any further queries do get in touch with me.Regards	Dr Sylvester	 MD"	0

post_8710921	post_3665075	"Dr.Sylvester	 My sister had Back sugery in 2008	 Where she had a titanium cage and screws placed in her back. After sugery she was in more pain then she had been before. and shortly after she started having other systems	 like bad headaches	 hives that come and go with bad itching. also she has pain through out her body and at times feels like she is going to pass out	 She has been back to the doctor that preformed the sugery and told all this to him. And even asked him if she could be allergic to the metal he put in her back. He dismissed this idea. Being fifty years of age    and knowing her body	 she knows there is something wrong. So right away she has gone on a quest to try to figure out what is happening to her body. She has been to neurologists	 neurosurgeons	 orthopaedic specialists	 and allergists. To no avail... It seems no one wants to get involved when they find out that her back injury is an L & I case where the case has been closed. She has had to pay out of her pocket for them all and is more then willing but does wish she could find some help. When she went to the allergist and wanted a test to see if she is allergic to the metal they put in her back he told her he didn't have any titanium	 but he'd be willing to perform the test but she would have to get the titanium from the company that produced the device. So she tried to get it from the company and they told her that they only gave samples to Doctors. She went back to the allergist with this news	 he was unwilling to go through the extra steps to get the sample because he said it is virtually unheard of for someone to be allergic to titanium.... So we are asking if you could point us in some direction to find some kind of help? She often feels like what ever is going on    with her body will kill her if she doesn't get some kind of help figuring out what is going on!!!! HELPLESS in Seattle. Thank you. Diana Davis"	0

post_3671067	post_3520058	Thanks you guys! I did try the Dawn product.. My husband cooked something and said what did you put in there! Ha. It was smoking... I guess I didn't rinse it as well as I thought. I self cleaned it again. It is the cleanest oven in town but still has the film though it seems to be going away as I attempt to work on it more and more. Thanks you guys!	0

post_2312360	post_2301646	I have heard you can take to much vitamin d but I dont know what would happen.    Like you I react to everything even natural stuff.    I just started taking D what symptoms were you having that the doctor checked you for that??	0
post_2322884	post_2301646	"I had had severe fatigue for a long time	 and the endocrinologist (my 3rd one) checked me for everything she could think of	 and tests came back showing very low Vitamin D.    I guess it made sense -- I seldom spend time outside	 and we live in a cold and rainy climate	 so where would I get the sunshine needed to make Vitamin D myself?    The dr. said my 'reservoir' of D was empty	 and taking just a regular daily dose would never let me catch up to where I should be	 so she prescribed the big dose.    I see others here have had the same prescription	 but no one comments if it had side effects.Aside from this	 I also had (have) ringing in my ears	 aches	 pains	 feeling miserable all the time	 poor memory	 mentally dull	 lethargic.    I never started taking the big-dose Vitamin D	 and in the meantime another doctor diagnosed a tick-bite disease and I'm on antibiotics for that	 feeling better enough to think about taking the Vit D tabs.    I am recently taking about 1000 to 2000 IU of Vit D3 each day	 sneaking up on bigger amounts	 and so far no problems -- I actually feel better.I've read that the usual recommended daily allowance of Vit D is likely insufficient for people who don't get sun	 and the supposed level of toxicity is about 2000 IU	 but if my tank is empty	 then I'm not concerned about overdose	 just about a bad physical reaction to a big whopping dose.    Since I posted a few days ago	 I've been taking the smaller 1000 - 2000 doses of Vit D	 so it's giving me courage to take the huge doses like the dr prescribed.    Just a nervous Nelly here.Thanks for your response	 it's appreciated.    Are your Vit D levels low too?"	0
post_2323831	post_2301646	"I too was prescribed 50	000 IU a week...... for 12 weeks.    I seem to be in the same boat as you as far as the symptoms and the sensitivity to medications.    I was very reluctant to take the large dose and waited until I saw my regular doctor (which didn't give me much reassurance).What happened is I went to for my regular female checkup (which was 3 years overdue) and told my gyno some of the problems I had been having.    She seemed concerned and did some pretty extensive bloodwork	 and because of the joint and muscle aches	 referred me to a Rheumatologist.    In the meantime some of my blood work came back abnormal such as the CRP and SED rate levels (which are indicators of inflammation somewhere in your body).    I saw the Rheumatologist and he suspected fibromyalgia	 but still wanted to do a few extra tests to rule out other things.    One of the tests was my vitamin D level which was 16 and dangerously low.He just called me in a prescription and had his nurse call me and tell me to follow up with my regular doctor!!!    I was ok with that until I got to the pharmacy and found out the prescription was for 50	000IU's!!I was very reluctant to start taking such a large dose without being under doctors supervision	 so I made an appointment with a regular doctor.    I went to him and he didn't know anything about vitamin D deficiency and told me to just take it like the other doctor told me to.    I have been searching for a doctor who is educated in this issue	 but haven't had much luck finding one.I started taking it and as of Friday have been on it for 6 weeks.    I seem to feel a little better	 but not what I expected to be feeling.    I have been so tired and achy for so long with no answers as to why	 that I thought this would be my answer.    I have read many things on vitamin D deficiency since then and most everything says that it is usually an underlying problem that causes the deficiency.    You don't just become deficient.    I myself	 drink plenty of fortified milk and dairy products	 and take a daily multi vitamin and have been for quite a while.    That was the last thing I would have ever thought would be low with me!!!I have also been taking caltrate with vitamin D and cod liver oil.    I have had extreme problems with memory lately and have read that cod liver oil is good for the brain.    I don't mind taking something that is natural like vitamins and minerals	 but I just absolutely despise taking prescription medication.I know this has been a long post	 but I have been on this site for several months and have not come across anybody that has had the same problems as me	 and it feels good to be able to discuss things with someone who understands.Thanks for posting	 and thanks for reading this!!!"	0

post_2332250	post_2301646	"Yes	 interesting you should mention Lyme ... I wrote you a long answer	 but the internet chewed it up somewhere.    I finally found	 after a couple dozen highly educated doctors	 a doctor* who tested me for Lyme and other similar diseases -- I have one that is like malaria	 carried by the same tick that carries Lyme.    I'm on the antibiotics now for both diseases	 and so far	 so good.    I'm feeling a little better.    Some days my memory is actually almost normal.    Other days...not so much	 but I'm better than I was.*We are in California	 and there is Lyme etc. out here too	 but not a lot of doctors take it seriously	 as you know.    I am lucky and there is a Lyme specialist not far away who seems to know his stuff and uses good labs to run the more accurate tests.    I didn't know you have it in Michigan too.Here's a trick I discovered:    I was having trouble sleeping because I hurt so bad all over	 and out of desperation	 I took some Benedryl to help me sleep.    After all	 it makes everybody a little drowsy	 and since I'm such a lightweight	 I figured	 what the heck	 it would probably knock me out.    And it did!    I started getting a full night's sleep again	 and that truly helped ... and when I was foggy and unable to focus during the day	 sometimes a tiny bit of Benedryl helped then too.    I don't think it's just the 'sleepiness' effect	 instead I think it reduces some of the swelling in my joints and my neck and my head	 and I can think straight again.    It's really amazing.    My neck and joints stop 'clicking'	 and suddenly the house work starts looking interesting again!    I'm going back to the dr soon and will let him know about my little discovery.I think I got a Vit D deficiency because we moved from a sunny place to a cold and cloudy place	 so I don't spend time outside like I used to	 and then when I got Lyme etc.	 I never went out unless I HAD to.    Doesn't surprise me that I'm deficient in Vit D	 so I don't know that I have any underlying condition.    I'll have to find my blood tests and see how low I am/was .....Thanks again ... it's good to know we're not alone ... well	 sort of good to know!    Keep trying	 keep trying to get well everyone."	0
post_2332299	post_2301646	"I'd suggest you keep trying to find either an infectious disease doctor or an immunologist or hematologist who has an interest in this area ... I see from your profile that you live in the Deep South	 and there is a tick borne disease called STARI	 for Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness	 similar to Lyme.    If you can find a doctor who focuses on that	 maybe you will make some progress.    Even within Lyme	 it seems to me from what I read that the tests are very specific to a particular bacterium	 and so the tests (which aren't very sensitive anyway) won't pick up the 'wrong' bug.A very nice	 well-educated	 and highly experienced doctor told me that anyone who really has Lyme is 'near death'	 and that anyone who is NOT 'near death' by definition does NOT have Lyme.    That's a bit of strange logic ... like saying that someone with cancer doesn't really have cancer because he's not yet at death's door.    There is a lot of denial about Lyme and other diseases	 I think because doctors are now so schooled in looking at the test results instead of at the patient and the symptoms.So all that means	 don't give up.    Keep looking.    The internet is your friend	 and just keep looking and reading till you find the right doctor to pay attention and work through things with you.

post_3862660	post_2301646	"Hi	Except for the following paragraph this is info I posted on another part of this site:I am adding one more thing because someone in this thread mentioned cod liver oil.    I think the Vitamin D Council people believe that if there are large amounts of Vitamin A in cod liver oil it may block part of the action of the Vitamin D.    Read the site for more info.Everyone here	 please see the following web-site with important Vitamin D information:http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/See the section on Pharmacology.    (Look at all the other sections too!)    Many of you have said your doctors have prescribed Vitamin D.    It may be that they have you taking ergocalciferol	 which is not as potent as cholecalciferol	 according to this site.    You do not need to have a prescription for Vitamin D.    This site says the best Vitamin D to take is cholecalciferol	 which is a Vitamin D3 that is available over the counter.    Do not take Vitamin D2.The site says - SUPPLEMENT WITH CHOLECALCIFEROLThe important thing to know: cholecalciferol is the vitamin D to take. Do not let your doctor give you any prescription medication for vitamin D. The only exception to this is ergocalciferol. Although with ergocalciferol you must remember you are taking a drug_  À_not a vitamin_  À_that does not normally occur in the human body.This site also has information on how to get testing.    They recommend that if you are going to self-supplement you should get tested periodically.    Some people will not need to supplement in the summer or contingent seasons.    The only way to know is to test.Also	 some of you say that you get sun.    This site explains the relationship between latitude and adequate sun exposure.    Also	 sunscreen blocks Vitamin D.    You can probably never get enough Vitamin D from diet alone.Educate yourselves.    Your doctors may be less educated about it than you can be.    Try to find a doctor who knows a lot about Vitamin D.    It is your health.Report thisby calwo	 11 minutes agoTo: AllIt sounds as though some of your doctors think that supplementing you for 8 weeks or so with the 50	000 iu prescription	 then continuing with a 1	000 iu over the counter D3 is enough.    If your levels drop with the lower dosage it is my opinion that you are not getting a ""bad"" bottle of D3.    You may not be getting enough D3.    Depending on your latitude and season you may need more.Go to the Vitamin D Council site (see post above.)Also	 I have heard that anti-convulsants such as Neurontin (gabapentin) can block Vitamin D.    I do not know if Lyrica would fall into that category	 so check.And again	 test	 test	 test.If you believe you cannot absorb vitamins intestinally the Vitamin D Council site (under Links or Resources) has a link to sun lamps.Report thisby calwo	 4 minutes agoTo: AllAnd another thing.See the Vitamin D Council site (look above for link) and make sure that your doctor is testing you for the correct type of Vitamin D.

I kept telling my doctors that I felt horrible	 being overweight my whole life I am acustom to doctors attributing everthing to my weight. Which of course they did.Six years ago my doctor phoned me to tell me my calcium level was high and that I should have it checked out further that it could be somemthing called your parathyroid. So I had by clacium checked and it was normal 	then elevated and that went on until 2 years ago unitl I said some one has to check my paratyroid levels. It was over the top	found an excellent surjeon had the gland removed hoping to finally get some relief. I did not.

post_4493618	post_2301646	"No	 I never did take the megadoses of Vit D.    I went ahead with the Lyme treatment and (with some setbacks) am making really good progress.As I have read more about Lyme etc.	 there is a theory out there that low Vit D is a symptom of something else	 not simply a lack of the vitamin.    Vit D is actually a steroid (never mind that it's called a 'vitamin') and it affects something like 1000 genes in your cells to do more or do less of whatever their job in life is.    I have read comments from people who have Lyme and are given Vit D	 and they have a VERY bad reaction to the Vit D	 because it is	 among those 1000 genes	 a suppressor of your immune system.    If you have a bacterial infection like Lyme	 you want your immune system up and running	 not switched off or suppressed.So I'm glad I didn't take the megadoses of Vit D	 or any extra Vit D at all.    I try to sit out in the sun when I can	 but don't often have the opportunity.    I am feeling much better tho	 so I don't think my low Vit D levels were the problem:    they were a symptom (and may still be	 since I don't have them checked anymore.)    The thinking is that the Lyme bacteria somehow hijack the Vitamin D and use it	 so that giving yourself more Vit D when you have Lyme just feeds the Lyme.    I don't know how well that's been proven	 but the stories of Lyme patients ending up in wheelchairs after taking Vit D sure got my attention.Thanks for your message -- much appeciated."	1

post_1922243	post_1920548	"I started questioning the vaccines before my daughter was born	 and after reading about what is in these shots	 and how they work (in some cases	 do not work)	 we have decided to not have ANY vaccinations for our children	 ever. There is most definately a real problem	 not just parents looking for someone to blame. There is no way you can put a large amount of Mercury	 along with other toxins and chemicals	 into a small child's body	 and not expect problems.The HepB shot that they give on the first day of birth also contains thimerasol	 and these babies are not at high risk. It us usually transmitted through intravenous drug use	 and sexual contact	 and can even wear off within 7 years. So not many babies would be at risk for this disease. And the symptoms of the vaccines can end up being much much worse (even fatal) in comparison to the illness itself.Here is a link with a list of the ingredients for the vaccines they put in our children:http://www.informedchoice.info/cocktail.htmlI would really study alot before you decide to have any (more) vaccinations for your child.

And she said that she could have kept her son's illness a secret and it would have made things easier on her... but she chose not to because she knows that there are many parent's out there that don't have the resources that she has had on this illness. They even had her son's physician on the show last night.btw	 her son's physician did an excellent job. Her son is doing great."	0

YES we have been poising you and many of your children for years. Yeah right! Can you imagine the lawsuits	 the anger	 and the backlash of millions of people? It would look like terrorists all over again.No one on the planet can say 100% of children_  s immune systems can tolerate them. But you the parent have a choice to give them to your kids or not. Ultimately you_  re the one who lives with your child dying from a possible disease or the injection you gave them that was supposed to save them but killed them or disabled them. Which is worse?My 3 children don't fit the mold....2 of my kids have had months of seizures after immunizations. My dr. will not admit they have any link. But I the mother know! When I had my 3rd child	 and I would not vaccinate and my dr. and I went to war over it.I told her; she can sign the release form not me!....why do I have to sign a release?.....I said to her tell me without a doubt that 100% of kids can tolerate the vaccines.....if that is true	 you sign the release to take the responsibility of it	 not me.She never questioned my choice again. She knew the anguish we went through with the first two kids. My son I will say had his reaction from the DTaP and he had seizures for 3 months after and then started a what the Dr. called ""A Fever Of Unknown Origin"".... that lasted 6 months. Every week I'd go to the dr. office praying for an ear-ache something and never was there anything. For 6 Months this 15 month old little boy suffered.

A lot of countries do not have autism because they do not have doctors capable of diagnosing it and/or populations of people who are unaware of how to spot it in their young children--limited educations and resources.Amazing what people believe if it is in print.When you do research--try to make it a reputable source.    Not just a source.By the way	 my children were vaccinated and are fine.    Be glad they are because we traveled overseas and unvax'd people here could have gotten sick if we had brought something back home with us.In today's transit society--polio still exists and there are still cases of it.To not vaccinate against such an awful disease is basically child abuse--in my CDC and travel educated opinion."	0
post_2773126	post_1920548	"We have done a ton of reserach and have decided on a delayed and selective vax schedule for ds. For example	 there is NO reason for a newborn to get the Hep B vax (if mom is negative and they are not in need of a blood transfusion). We opted out of that until later. I don't think we need to vax against chicken pox or roto (plus that vax is far too new for me to be comfortable with it especially since it was pulled once already in it's short self-life!). We're doing one vax per month and will do HIB	 DTaP	 and Prevnar. I will probably do Polio but later (around 12m). We will do MMR but I will get the separate shots and do one per 6m as not to overload ds's system.There's a lot to think about on this and there is no right or easy answer. But I have been thinking and the AAPs schedule is based on convience and nothing else.Plus	 I am exclusively breastfeeding and will continue to breastfeed until at least 2y (dd made it through 3.5y) That really helps and makes me feel better about my decision as breastmilk is the original and natural vax as far as I'm concerned! Also	 we don't travel outside of the US so I'm not concerned there.Dr. Sears new book is a good resource but I have read a lot of original research as well. The truth is that when you look at population studies vaccines work	 but they can't do the type of trials required to demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between vax and disease prevention. Also	 the trials that are done have a lot of interesting quirks....like ""sheding"" and vicarious immunity. Very interesting stuff and it's a lot to digest. We don't know what the side effects really are and it is a good think that we no longer have to worry about Polio or Diptheria....but chicken pox? Really? The motivation behind that was solely financial and that's crossing a line in my oppinion."	1
post_2981292	post_1920548	"You stated that India is a polio endemic country	 and implied that it is due to lack of vaccines.    I would surmise it is because they don't have clean water	 good waste management	 knowledge of handwashing and quarantine.    In many underdeveloped countries	 they use the local lakes for drinking water	 cooking water and WASTE.    Water wells	 sewer systems	 soap	 and education regarding handwashing and quarantine	 in addition to good nutrition	 would help fight against disease more than vaccines ever could!    According to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny	 many of the diseases in America	 i.e. polio	 were on their way out before vaccines for each disease were required	 due to water sanitation	 waste management	 handwashing and quarantine.My daughter became allergic to her milk-based formula less than two days after her four month shots	 so we switched her to soy formula.    Her second day of rice cereal	 she threw it all up.    I was constantly refeeding her until her 18-month allergy test which revealed she was allergic to peanut	 nuts	 dairy	 eggs (we knew)	 beef	 chicken	 pork	 mustard	 garlic	 carrots	 and even rice	 which the allergist said to disregard the rice	 but our experience confirmed it.    She has had all of her shots and she is eight years old	 but upon learning of the formaldehyde	 antifreeze	 aluminum	 ether	 mercury	 monkey kidney tissue	 chicken embryos	 animal blood in vaccines	 I have decided to never again give her any more shots.

post_3472491	post_1920548	"It's all about the immune system everyone.    Should you choose not to have the shots	 it's very important to keep your childs immune system strong and healthy through nutrition	 sleep etc.    Blood tests have shown children that have not been vaccinated	 and they have all of the necessary antibodies which they came into contact	 but because they're immune systems were strong they were able to not get sick from the illness	 rather	 produce antibodies	 which for some illnesses	 gives them lifetime immunity as opposed to 65-95% effective vaccines.    And for the mother who thinks that opposing vaccines is child abuse	 i say	 giving them is child abuse.    if you know the damages that are even possible from the vaccines	 why would you put your child at risk?    why not take a little more time	 some extra mommy work and research to keep your children healthy	 and learn about the symptoms of the diseases should you need to treat them.    it's like many have stated in the past	 you're playing ""russian roulette""    with your children.    All in all	 I agree that this decision is a unique one for every mother	 and not every child is going to react the same way to the shots.    So if you're doing the shots	 wait as long as possible	 choose what's necessary	 space them out	 and keep your child's immune system as strong as possible.

I hope that I do not offend anyone	 I'm just trying to educate myself.There's a lot of discussion about seizures being paired with vaccinations.    I know that seizures can be caused by very high fevers	 and I have also seen that vaccinations are capable of causing fevers.

This website	 http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm is a great source for autism.Although there is a great deal of skepticism involving vaccinations	 there is still no concrete proof correlating it with autism.    I just wanted to point out	 because a couple people referred to websites to support their claims	 that you need to be careful with you resources.

post_3555268	post_1920548	"Also	 if a child still becomes sick with the disease after being treated with a vaccine	 then it's very likely that the child has an immune disorder.    A vaccine is often times a deactivated version of the pathogen (bacteria	 fungi...)	 and in order for the body to build up an immunity	 it practices by fighting the inactivated pathogen.    Therefore	 when the actual bacteria shows up	 the immune system is quick to respond because it already knows how to fight the infection.This is in response to a quote taken from this forum: ""My son had his shots and also contracted Whooping cough	 measles and rubella...so much for safe and EFFECTIVE..that is when I woke up...I wondered why did he get the shots only to contract the diseases FROM the shots?""Also	 if your son has all these infections	 and is proved to not have an immune system disorder	 then he must be exposed to harmful pathogens on a daily basis to receive all of those infections."	0

I would make sure that you try age appropriate remedies though.    I've also heard Omega-3	 and B vitamins help.    I haven't had much success with those personally.    Maybe you could try aroma-therapy.    Try burning some essential oil in the background while he is trying to do his homework. Does he have homework? Lavender works well.    Or make a room mist with peppermint oil	 which is very volatile. I buy my essential oils at the health market at my grocery store.    ""Young Living"" is a good brand. Make sure they say 100% pure	 or theraputic grade	 they also should not have the same price on different oils.    You don't want the synthetic fragrance you want the real thing.    It helps when I am in a pleasant environment that is well organized and distraction free. Something else you might try is	 tokens.    I don't suggest this but	 I used to use cigarettes as a type of motivation to focus and get work done. I quit smoking so now I just give myself a pat on the back.     Maybe you could use some type of reward system for good behavior. Something I wish I would have worked on when I was younger was goals and motivating factors.    It's really a struggle when you are always battling your ADD and it can cause alot more problems down the road especially if you make it a big issue for him.

post_2082125	post_2080416	"For myself problems with my blood sugar have cause bad problems with my ability to control my impulses and to focus.    You might try cutting out sugar from his diet.    Avoid anything refined	 and cut down on fruit.    To see much of a difference you'll need to really keep an eye on it and make sure he's getting other sources of energy.    For times when I really need to focus standing on my head for a few minutes at a time seems to help too.    Sounds weird	 but it works.Supplement wise... caffiene without the sugar is good.    So like janesez suggested Green Tea is great for that	 but black tea is better.    The regular lipton tea bags are loaded with caffeine	 so is Earl Grey.    You can sweeten it with Stevia (which is great stuff BTW).    Essentially you want to stimulate his mind	 not his body	 hence the reason to avoid the sugars.    You can also try L-carnitine.    It helps with converting cellular energy and metabolizing fats.     This page: http://www.evitamins.com/healthnotes.asp?ContentID=1004008 has some info on that and diets too.Cognitive therapy is going to go a long ways too.    Maybe get him into a martial arts program	 it would give him a place to burn off his energy while teaching him to focus.

post_4049455	post_2080416	"I have a little boy who has ADHD and Asperguer's and believe me when I tell you that there is no drug that can deal with that.It is very challenging to rise and live with a child who is always mad	 aggressive    and has explanations for everything	 it can be so	 so frustrating.My son is 9 now and he has been on meds forever	 but it did not work and he was more lunatic that anything while drugged	 also very depressed.Now we areworking with Homeopathic medicine and it is working very well.    (Also 9 years of behavioral training are paying off	 finally!)I know how you feel	 and how this affects your marriage	 I walked the road too. But if you love your husband you must try to love the kid as your own and do something for him	 that his mother will not. Love him	 and bear him. Now	 there is no rest stop on this highway	 it is high speed all the way	 but you can manage	 look out for support groups	 you need to cry out your anxiety	 if you crash he crashes too and so does your husband.There are many places that you can go for help	 ask in Public Health office or talk to the school's social worker. Go and ask for a non-profit organization in your area that provides Mental Health services	 they normally have ""scale fees"" based in your income	 most people do not pay at this organizations	 or pay just 10 bucks or so for each visit. They can also help with meds... but this is a dangerous path that you must be aware of.My heart goes to you	 keep strong	 good luck.Judith"	1
post_4054764	post_2080416	Before we tried medicine for my son who has ADHD I heard that if u take all gluten and caseins (a milk by product) out of your child's diet that can help with the ADHD (these people say ADHD is just a different kind of allergic reaction to certain things in our diet).    I did not have any success with it.    But I do know parents that have had success with it.    I think it just depends on the child.    My son does very well with his medicines.    I feel with the focalin xr (15 mg) he is on and Clonidine he does a lot better than before on his work in school (and listening to me).    Good Luck!	0
post_4055054	post_2080416	"Stucture and patience........my 23 yr is ADHD and was never on meds.    We used behavior contracts	 rewards and concrete immediate consequences that mattered to him.    Every time he came home without homework....we went back to school	 got it then no TV	 video games	 etc for that night.    We did this from k-middle school....by HS he didn't need that anymore.    We had strict curfews especially when he started driving and enforced them.    Including the time I went to the ""party"" house in my PJ's when he was late.In HS....we continued with the contract but also paid for grades......he graduated as an honor student and recently grad from college.It was not east and still isn't.    ADHD kids are less mature than their peers	 tend to be impulsive and don't see the consequences of their actions.    If you can create a positive structure with consistent consequences that matter to your son....you can get great results.BTW....because of my son's high energy level we very seldom grounded him and we never took away sports.    I had to come up with creative alternatives....some were a little ""out"" there.    Today we laugh about some of them."	0

post_4416865	post_2080416	"Well	 I am sure you have it all taken care of by now but I thought that I will still give my advice for others that may have this same problem.I have dealt with ADD issues for my whole life and still have them as an adult. I also have been in contact with many children with severe ADD symptoms. So my advice is as follows:For school work:1. Children with ADD hate school. They will do anything to avoid doing homework because it is hard	 they don't get it	 and it takes a long time (people with ADD tend to take about twice as long to do the same work as someone without it)a. Keep in constant contact with the teachers. i.e. Have them sign an assignment notebook that the child wrote down their assignment in (in pen because they will surely erase the assignments in pencil after the teacher has signed it)	 or have the teacher send you a daily email with the assignments for the day.b. When studying	 mix it up. And mix it up often. People with ADD get bored very easily when doing things they are not interested in. Make flash cards	 have them read it out loud	 you read it out loud to them	 quiz them	 make homemade worksheets.c. Have an area set aside with NO distractions. Some students can study with music in the backround	 the TV on	 or with a view of the outside world	 but students with ADD can't handle that and still be productive. They already battle the distractions in their head about EVERYTHING else	 outside distractions should be minimal	 if not	 nonexistant.d.     Take lots of breaks. People with ADD get frusterated and a feeling of their ""brain being full"". Every 20 or 30 minutes let them get up for a few minutes and walk around.2. At homea. Structure! I can't express how important structure is. Everyday should be very close to the same. Study time	 dinner time	 bed time	 tv time...they should all be at the same time everyday. It reduces frustration and provides comfort in knowing what is going to happen and when. Behavior problems will decrease drastically once the child gets used to this one small step.b. Take everything away. Most parents give their children everything and take things away when they do things the parents don't approve of. In my experience this teaches children to find ways around it. (Don't get caught and nothing will happen). It teaches to hide poor behavior as opposed to showing off good behavior. By taking everything away from the beginning and allowing priveledges for studying	 or chores it gives a feeling of accomplishment and pride in what they have done. This is particularly helpful in kids with ADD since they have very low self esteem. Think about it	 you don't get cable if you don't go to work and make the money to pay for it. You earned your TV time.c. Provide immediate concequences for actions. For children with ADD a great one to try is physical activity. This helps relieve frustration	 burn off energy	 and also promotes physical activity. The amount should reflect the issue. For example	 your child back-talks you - 10 push ups	 your child takes TV time without earning it - 50 push ups	 your childs hits his kid sister	 100 jumping jacks. Do the same thing	 EVERYTIME.d.    Put it in writing. Put house rules in writing. That way	 there is no forgetting and no mistaking.Good Luck. I hope this advice works. Teaching children how to cope with ADD is something that will follow them their whole life. ADD doesn't go away but if you can learn how to deal with your individual problems you can overcome it!If anyone has any questions please feel free to contact me atbrandi.***@****Entitle it: ADD Posting"	0

post_6770735	post_2080416	"I've been ADD since I was 10 or so. It affected my ability to focus and learn. Sadly back then	 it was just perceived to be a behavioral issue and not something that could be dealt with socially. We've come a long way in terms of learning what is helpful and not. I really enjoyed reading so many comments posted about people's own challenges and how they've coped. I thought it would be only right for me to offer my suggestions.1. Diet is very important! The foods and beverages I consume today is vastly different than when I was growing up or in college (budget constraints!) Pick up on more raw foods! Uncooked foods offer the greatest natural nutrients to the body and mind!2. Social involvement: Sounds absurd but the people you associate with	 the conversations you have on a daily basis impact greatly how you feel and your ability to effectively participate. Basically	 you have to surround yourself with people and activities that help you thrive!3. A little supplemental nudge! I've personally tried vitamins and B has helped but issue is they are a little too synthetic (rarely food-based) and hence I don't know that they are as effective. I decided to try natural food-based supplements that could possibly give me the brain endurance I needed to focus (my greatest adversary!) I've been taking VavAlert ( http://www.vavalertusa.com ) for about 6 months now and honestly been blown away by its impact on how I feel and perform	 mainly with regards to improving concentration and focus.4. Learn to not multi-task! This is also a big one! Multi tasking is overrated and creates ONE BIG Problem! It distracts you from FOCUSING!I hope my pointers help someone! I look forward to reading other people's experiences along the way!"	0

post_8121895	post_2080416	"I have 5 children. Three have ADHD and one has ADD. My first child could not be tested until he was 4 years of age.They have all been on meds. We stopped all meds for all 4 of them. Two of them manage well without it. However	one son has suffered with ADHD a little more than the others. He is aggressive. When he isn't on his medication he doesn't sleep well. Every night he talks in his sleep sometimes hollers out loud. Gets up and walks through the house and I have to walk him back to bed. He is very restless. He usually dreams horrible dreams that something is after him. Scary stuff. He is very smart. He needs meds but I would much rather some type of herbal theraphy. The least little thing sets him off and he's ready to attack his siblings. We were going to do a sleep study and we had a storm come through at that time and his doctor at that time moved. So we never proceeded with it. My youngest is having a very hard time with aggression also. Anyone have any suggestions?"	1
post_8122566	post_2080416	"I am glad to hear that two of your kids are doing ok without the meds.    I feel for your older one.     I have never found or seen a natural remedy that will work for ADHD.     Omega 3's do seem to help a little.    The sleep study is important.    All the research I have seen shows that lack of sleep will make ADHD symptoms worse.    The question is what is causing the lack of sleep?    The reasons can be either physical (swollen adenoids(adenoids)	 etc)	 ADHD related (its a common symptom)	 or environmental (his sleeping area and people in it).A lot of physical activity will help him.    How old is he?    I mean if you could get him on a swim team and exhaust him - you would notice a difference!         Melatonin might help.    But	 it may be that he will be the one that really does need some kind of medication to help him through the day and night.    This is where a good responsive doctor is really important!As for your youngest one - at least part of his aggression problems may be his older brothers and sisters (?).    Kids do learn from those around them!    But here again	 I don't know how old he is and can't really suggest specific ideas until I know that.I would highly suggest (especially since all of your kids have some form of AD/HD) to buy the book	     ""The ADD/ ADHD Answer book	"" by Susan Ashley.    Its only about 10 bucks via Amazon.    It will give you a ton of very helpful information.    I also can give you lots of web sites to go to for help	 but I really need more info.    Don't be afraid to ask for more info.    But if you could please address just one child at a time - it makes giving help a lot easier.    Best wishes."	1

post_3767000	post_3649515	"Hey	 Sharon	I received your note.    I don't have an answer	 but I can maybe help you think about it differently	 if that might help.If I understand correctly	 the cat hasn't eaten anything for 4 days	 which should mean it's ravenous and sluggish from lack of nutrition.    Cats are carnivorous and designed to eat meat.    Even if the cat is used to solid	 crunchy food the natural instincts should be taking over when presented with meat when hungry.    Not eating meat when hungry is highly unusual for a cat.    I think it's more likely to eat disgusting-tasting meat (meat infused with Neoplasene)    than disgusting-tasting crunchy carbohydrate mix.    You can also try mixing with a small amount of water and squirting it down the cat's throat with a hypodermic (without the needle) syringe.    Have extra water on hand for the cat to wash it down and wash away the taste.At this stage	 and the cat not eating meat	 I would definitely start injections	 assuming it still won't eat and you can't squirt it down the throat.    You've already determined Neoplasene isn't harmful to normal tissue	 so you've got nothing to lose; whether oral or injection	 it gets into the bloodstream where it does tremendous good.I'd ask the vet to monitor the level of inflammation once treatment starts because once Neoplasene unmasks the hidden cancer cells	 the immune system will attack the cancer	 causing high levels of inflammation.    You may also see high levels of antigens to the cancer cells showing in the blood.    These are all good things.Hang in there."	0

I then mixed the Neoplasene with with salmon oil	 drew it up in a 3 cc syringe	 gave it to him immediately after he ate	 and then washed it down with water.    So far	 four times and with no ill effects.    My only other question is	 as far as your knowledge	 this shouldn't effect the absorbtion at all so technically	 he should get the right dose - correct?    The only reason I ask is that when I spoke with Dr. Fox	 he seemed to stress that being creative with feeding is not a good thing	 and mixing it with all the food is the way to go.    But wouldn't that process happen in the stomach anyway?And as far as the swelling	 there is a small amount but nothing major yet.    Does it take a couple of days	 weeks?    He's only had full doses for a day and a half	 and we haven't increased to the 120 mg yet (he's on 60 mg as of now).    He seems very bright and playful	 not feeling bad or sick.Guidance and advise is appreciated."	0
post_3771719	post_3649515	"Hey	 Sharon	I am so happy for you that you now are getting kitty to take treatment.Regarding oral with or without food	 I think the reason Dr. Fox stresses the feeding program isn't so much due to percentage-that-makes-it -into-the-bloodstream	 but rather due to the fact the animal is likely to reject it unless you find an on-going method that works -- which	 so far	 always involves mixing with their food.    Altering feeding patterns lessens the likelihood that the animal will continue accepting oral treatment.    The treatment should work	 if I understand correctly	 even on an empty stomach.    The good thing is getting it into the stomach and eventually to the tumor(s) or other neoplasm.The oral dose limit is the level at which the animal can no longer tolerate the gastric distress.    The antiemetic Reglan increases that limit.Again	 I'm not a vet so I'm not qualified to give advice.    These are opinions I hold that seem to be reasonable and are based on observation and Dr. Fox's 96 page Clinical Guide (which advises care when treating cats as they have a lower tolerance	 apparently).While the cancer is dying	 the cat's temperature may go up due to the additional inflammation	 for a while.    This is not unusual.    It's also not unusual to have to stop the treatment due to gastric distress for awhile	 and then restart with no ill effects later.    I think the important thing is that you are using what appears to be the most effective treatment available for solid tumors.Continued good health to your cat."	0

post_1986358	post_1984179	"Hi SimplyStar	 You're asking a very good question.    Food has a huge impact on how fast cancer cells grow.    Most curries have tumeric in them.    Turmeric is known to kill cancer cells.Also	 Indian yogic texts from thousands of years ago talk about Pranayama (breathing techniques).    These breathing techniques oxygenate body cells and in the process the oxygen kills cancer cells.    The website below talks about the following two techniques which are known to help cancer patients:Technique #1 - Kapalbhati PranayamaTechnique #2 - Anulom Vilom Pranayamhttp://www.yogsandesh.org/articles/33/1/Pranayama-Techniques-of-Swami-Ramdev/Another thing	 SimplyStar	 is the abundant availability of Ayurveda meds in India which slow down cancer growth.    Here	 in the US	 there are limitations to imports of these herbal meds.    The following website talks about effects of Ayurveda meds on cancer patients:http://www.ayurvediccancertherapy.com/reference.htm"	1
post_1986494	post_1984179	I think a lot of it has to do with the sedentary life style.India consumes so much turmeric. A    know anti-cancer spice. But that's just part ot it.Japan eats so much out of the sea including a lot of seaweed. Look at them--not many overweight.It's all    agricultural. Common sense. Everything from our yard fertilizers and herbicides to big farming sprays. Look at what's happening with the amphibians in the ponds where there is run off. They are all deformed.All this is in our foods and ends up in the water supply. Also is spread through the air with diesel and exhaust.Our wonderful modern conveniences are killing us.I take New Chapter turmeric.And yes stress causes us not to breath properly. Most of us don't fully breath thru the diaphram.	1

post_1380644	post_1341558	"About 10 years ago I decided that commercial deodorants was what was causing increasing high rate of breast cancer in women in America compared to women in Thailand where I now live. This is my theory: Up until about 25 years ago	 Thai women used limestone as deodorant and breast cancer rate was very low     Many women in Westernized countries use commercial products and shave underarms exposing the pores thus allowing chemicals to seep towards the breasts areas....everyday!!!! So I stopped and switched to natural deodorant..I bought 2 different kinds (same brand)	 1 anti-perspirant and deodorant and 1 deodorant at a health food store.    Then one day I read the ingredients & discovered that the anti-perspirant bottle still had aluminum but the deodorant one did not!!

I'm happy with tom's of maine deodorant stick unscented.I once shared this with a group of firiends and was told go to a website that's about urban legends and about aluminum in deodorants doesn't cause cancer.

post_1788693	post_1783288	"Wow...it is nice to see that your child was diagnosed so early.    Sounds like she has made great strides.    Early intervention is so important.    I have one main suggestion for you.    I am a behavior specialist who specializes in autism.    What you are experiencing with your daughter is common for children on the spectrum.    She is verbal which is nice.    They often speak in script or string nonsensical	 made-up words together.    This is their way of playing and experimenting with words and learning how to use them purposefully.    They often like the sounds of certain words and will say things just because it brings them pleasure.    This is not bad.    She will eventually become more competent in speech with time.    Encourage any and all attempts to communicate (verbal	 gestural	 pictures	 etc.).    However	 let me give you one important suggestion.Kids with autism	 even the ones who can speak very well	 have strong difficutly relating with others.    They have trouble with reciprocal interaction	 the give and take	 back and forth regulation of conversing.    They usually need to control the interaction.    Part of this difficutly is their strong lack of being able to read the subtle cues and nonverbal language in communication.     About 70% of our communicating is through nonverbal language (facial expressions	 body posture	 gestures	 fluctuations/intonation in voice	 pauses	 etc.)    We process this information subconsciously.    It allows us to read between the lines	 and read the perspective and intentions of the other person.    People with autism have great difficutly with nonverbal language and often cannot interact well with others because of that.     Normal children learn to communicate nonverbally before learning their first words.    They already learn to process and read nonverbal language before becoming fluent in speech.    Children with autism do not pick up that early milestone.     However	 you can teach your daughter to read nonverbal language by using less words.     Use alot of animated facial expressions and exaggerated gestures when communicating.     Focus on nonverbal language (exaggerating it) and only use words to augment the nonverbal.     This forces the child to reference your face and actions to read communication intent. It also helps the child to ""relate"" rather then just talk.     It is alot of fun	 and very beneficial for the child.    Speak less and say more with your actions and facial expressions.    Our families play fun interactive games with ""zip your lip"" and ""lose your words.""    They pick any daily event and both the parent and child have to do it together with using no words.    It is fun and forces the parent to learn to exaggerate their nonverbal language.    It also forces the child to learn how to read nonverbal language.Good Luck	Bill"	0

All day she communicates in jibber-jabber throwing in real words on occasion. Rarely puts two to three word phrases together. I'd say - until just about 6 months ago she did not like to interact with other kids...she liked to be around them...but not really interacting. She is improving with the socail aspect a lot. I don't really know if some of her strange behavior is due to just being delayed or just being a toddler. OR somthing more. She is being tested later this month. She has good eye contact and is affectionate. No interest in potty training and occasionally still will put her hand in a soiled diaper. Though greatly improved my little girl used to have frequent and intense temper tantrums.

post_1867117	post_1783288	"I guess all of these questions come together for me.    My daughter was developing very typically	 crawled on time	 actually spoke early	 everything seemed to be going great.    WE saw nothing strange in the way of eye contact	 facial expression	 nothing.    When I took her in to get a her vaccinations at about 14 months the doctor suggested we get the flu shot as well.    At the time my daughter had a low grade fever and I told the doctor that I just wanted a checkup no vaccinations because I knew that you weren't supposed to give them to a sick child.    After being chastized and basically called an idiot for thinking something like that	 the doctor insisted that she give her all of the immunizations because the sickness would have no effect on anything.    so she got the shots	 including the flu shot.    The next week we were in the Prompt Care with her having bronchiolitis and an ear infection which required antibiotics.    the doctor in there told us that we never should have gotten her immunizations with her being sick...soon after we started noticing changes.    It was like a film was put over her eyes	 the light seemed gone.    No	 or very little eye contact	 her words stopped	 it was just very different.    My husband and I both noticed these things	 were told by our new pediatrician that she just had a speech delay	 leave it alone	 she'd come around.    We decided to take her in to a child psychologist who specialized in autism to have her evaluated.After talking to him we saw what all of the signs were that she was actually exhibiting...poor eye contact	 a lack of understanding of language	 severely delayed speech	 no desire to play with other children (although she loved to be around other kids)	 no pretend play.Now after having implemented the GFCF diet (which we saw dramatic changes with in a matter of 2 weeks)	 having in home ABA therapy for 8months-4 hours a day/5days a week	 after that starting an autism preschool program and has now been in it for 3 months...she is now mainstreaming most of her day into a regular preschool.    Her play with others is amazing	 her eye contact is great	 her teacher actually said that she plays with others more than most typically developing 3 year olds do in her class.She is still not potty trained	 but we're not pushing it either	 in her own time we'll get there.    She does repeat some lines from shows	 but it's hard to tell because she often does it with her own voice inflection in order to get us to laugh at what she's saying.Sorry this was so long	 but I appreciate everyone's comments and questions and hoped that I answered some questions for you as well."	1

post_2908571	post_2904009	"I would say find out about the vaccine your child is going to have to make sure you know what is in it.I have a son with autism	 but I don't think the vaccine caused it because he was showing some symptoms before the notorious MMR vaccination.    But I do think that some people have a genetic weakness that may be triggered by an environmental factor.    There is also truth in the fact that children who do not have the vaccinations are only covered because the rest of the children that are immunised and the less children covered means there is more chance of an outbreak of something serious.There have also been autistic people who have posted about this subject saying they would rather be immunised than to get something that could seriously damage their health or even kill them.That leaves us parents in a rather difficult situation because all we want to do is to do the best for our children.If you already have autism in the family then that is something else to factor in.I think it is important from a immune system point of view to allow our children to get dirty to allow their bodies to build up their own immune system.Children with an autistic spectrum disorder usually start to show problems with language ie. language delay	 appearing not to understand language	 repeating what the parent has just said or no talking at all.    But that would mean delaying vaccinations for a couple of years.    Children with Aspergers don't usually get diagnosed until around the age of 7 because they have no recognisable language problems or delays.Whooping cough can kill.    But I have had whooping cough and am okay.    There is no easy answer.There are also alot of autistic people and parents of autistic children who would say a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder is not the end of the world.    But a severely autistic child would be much harder to cope with.    Sometimes the fear is worse than the actual thing.Some parents are convinced the vaccine damaged their child.I know I'm rambling	 but this is the way the argument always goes.    There is no clear cut answer.Find out as much as you can about the actual vaccine your child would get.    Find out about the diseases it prevents	 the possibility of your child getting it and the consequences of that.    Talk to your doctor about the possibility of delaying it.

One side thinks the other side is off track and neither are willing to budge...I thought of this if it puts anything into perspective... There's no scientific basis that I know of... I have read about shots	 the process of injecting a foreign substance directly into the bloodstream causing an autoimmune response for animals and people succeptable genetically...Perhaps it is this autoimmune response that gets triggered by the shot	 thus triggering discomfort	 headaches and general malise...If someone was genetically autistic all of a sudden	 their autism shows up a lot worse because the toddler is cranky and not feeling well.    If they are autistic	 it will surface up as a lot of negative autistic behaviors... It's negative behaviors that send parents to see the psychos (psychologists/psychiatrists). After all who would be complaining if their child could rattle off 100 presidents before they knew how to tie their shoe?Because of this	 a lot more people are getting diagnosed with autism than would be normally without an autoimmine response.For the supporters of shots ""causing"" autism	 perhaps there is naturally a little bit of an autoimmune thing in many people	 but the trigger makes a full blown case...For those that notice unconventional treatment working maybe alleviating the autoimmune disorder is getting rid of most of the negative behaviors	 thus making their child not appear as autistic anymore.-----------My question is: if there was a full cure: Would it take away some of the good traits as well as the bad?

For those in my family who have it	 it means their body cannot process iron and get it out of the body so it builds up and causes liver damage and other symptoms that are irreversable.    The 'cure' is to not eat foods containing iron and to regularly have blood taken to dilute the iron content within the body systems.I also have many family members who cannot take any drugs because they have extreme reactions to them and I mean 'extreme' reactions.So	 to me	 it seems logical that if some people have adverse reactions to some things it is quite possible that some people may have adverse reactions to vaccines.    In the same way that some people are allergic to cats	 but the vast majority of people aren't. In the same way that some people take ectasy and are okay but another person takes a tab and dies	 in the same way that skunk is suspected of causing/triggering skizophrenia in some adults but not in others.I don't think vaccines cause autism.    I don't think you can recover from autism or cure autism.    I think autism is what you are.I just wish people would consider the 'what if'.    As I said	 I am for vaccines.    I am also for allowing kids to get dirty and get ill	 that is what the immune system is for.But for all those people who are so pro-vaccine	 I can bet a million dollars that if autism turned up in your child you would begin to question everything.    That is healthy.There is no answer to this debate other than find out the correct information about vaccines	 look at your family history and make the decision.    Whatever you decide you have to live with the consequences of that.I have had my children vaccinated.    One of my children is on the autistic spectrum.    If I had another child	 (which I doubt)	 I probably would vaccinate but at a later date.    That may make no sense to anyone else	 but that is my opinion.It is a similar question as to whether	 having had a child on the spectrum	 would you consider an abortion if you became pregnant again.    Everyone would have their own individual opinon on that	 varying from one extreme to the other.    I am just trying to be honest as to how I feel.    I am not trying to convert anyone to my way of thinking."	0

Your Mum should ask for a copy of the pathology report	 as this will define her individual parameters.    It may seem at first like a foreign langugage	 but once you have it	 you can come back here for us to interpret.If the tumour was over 1 cm	 my breast care centre of excellence always recommends chemo and radiotherapy. Similarly	 if the cancer has already spread to the axilla (armpit)	 this shows the cancer is on the move and chemoo will be advised.     As an example	 I had a 2 cm invasive ductal tumour with associated DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) and 4/18 lymph nodes positive for bc. I too wondered why I needed both chemo and radiotherapy. My Oncologist explained that as the cancer had already spread to the lymph nodes	 microscopic cancer cells may have spread to other organs i.e. lungs	bones	liver or spine and the chemo is to kill these cells. Radiotherapy is to zap any remaining cancer cells in the breast and axilla.     If there is no spread from the breast	 then radiotherapy alone is usually advised.Your Mum should also know:What is the hormone status of the tumour? Er (estrogen)	 PR (progesterone) and HER2.If she is post menopausal and has ER/PR+ cancer	 she should be prescribed Arimidex. If pre-menopausal	 tamoxifen.If HER2+ Herceptin witll be prescribed.The type of chemo (there are many) will be decided by the Oncologist for her individual case.After my surgeries (lumpectomy and then total axillary removal) I had a bone scan	 liver scan and chest x-ray to make sure there was no spread to these organs. Thankfully it had not. I had 6 rounds of FEC chemo	 every 3 weeks	 then 25 rads - daily Mon-Fri with a break at weekends. My cancer was diagnosed almost 5 yrs ago and I believe there are newer chemo therapies. Thankfully	 I have had no recurrence.I don't know if this is the information you want - if not	 come back and one of us will try and answer your questions.Hope your Mum soon feels better.Liz."	0

post_2196893	post_2195032	"Hi	The pathophysiology of breast cancer accepted at present is that it is n o more local pathology but a systemic disease. Hence there is no point in just addressing the local management	 and systemic burden should also be addressed. The surgery plays a role    in    eliminating the local tumour load. The systemic ones require chemotherapy or the hormonal therapy.Various factors decide the role of further management1. the hormone receptor status2 tumour histology and the grade3. margins of the resected specimen for clearanceAt this stage you would require a oncologist opinion for deciding further.

Instead of killing people with their toxic chemotheraphy and breaking peoples systems down then sending them home to die...its cruel.    Chemo is designed to give people hope that their doctors know what is right. Here are some statistics by two prominent Professors one an Oncologist	 the other a Radiologist.http://www.laetrile.com.au/otherpages/chemo1.htm--------------------where to purchase cellular zeolite online :-http://www.zeolitedirect.com/zeolite-products.phpCancer Strategy #1: Use Zeolite To Kill Cancer Cells...Without Harming Your BodyChemotherapy and radiation therapy tries to kill the cancerous cells. Unfortunately	 they often harm your body in the process. There are natural supplements that do a good job of killing cancerous cells	 but don't cause harm to your body. A few supplements do have potential to be toxic to the body	 and should probably just be used in conjunction with a naturopath or alternative doctor. These include cesium	 artemisia	 and B17. In this report you will learn only about completely safe cancer supplements that can be used with no supervision.You may well ask why 	 if a safe and natural product is able to kill cancer	 doesn't your doctor recommend it. Of course	 he probably doesn't know about it	 but even if he did	 he's not likely to use it.It's the nature of the medical/drug industry. Doctors use and recommend drugs that are approved in a process that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The drug companies only make drugs that can be patented. That way they can sell them for huge mark-ups and have no competition.Lady00712/10/07ALL    Did you know that CAT SCANS are equivalent to 400 chest xrays in Radiation.Did you know that TAXOL kills veins and cripples the area where its been administered....Did you know that HERCEPTIN 2 gives your cardiotoxidity...weakens your HEART...TAXOL combined with HER2 Govt approved only if you take HER2 WITH TAXOL...wow    That sounds like blackmail..Their aim is to kill you one way or the other.Lady00712/10/07ALL    After feeling three lumps in my left breast last december 2006.    They did a mamogram(mammogram)on the breast and you could see the lumps quiet clear.    I then went on to have the biopsy which was via Ultra sound visual system by which you could see the lumps quiet clear again.    These lumps turned out to be grade 3 Cancer	 which had infected two lympnodes.     I then had surgery after nuclear dye had been administered to keep the Doc on track when removing my breast and finding all the supposed infected areas. The surgeon took 15 lympnodes plus the sentinal gland in this operation along with the whole breast removal.    It was the ongoing treatment that had me rather bewildered as to the system of which followed.    I was hit with AC x 4 Cyclophosphamide	 Amend	 Granistron	 Hydrochlorid	 and    Dexamethasone [sent my sugar levels sky high spent week in hospital with that] with maxalon to stabalize my system and diabetic 2 medications.    This was only in the first 4 treatments at 3 week intervals.    Then HER2 combined with TAXOL another 4 treatments...Now I am down onto HER2 on its own...My heart rate first up was 38% next 42% next 47% the next test is pending.    I have decided that if the heart does not come up over 50% next test that my treatment should be stopped.    I need an opinion here?Lady00712/10/07ALL    To my way of thinking my breast should have been hit with radiation to shrink the cancer berfore surgery was administered.    Thus giving a more direct approach to the cancer via the surgeon.    Then when the wound was healed I should have been hit again with radiation.    Then to complete the process of doses of HER2 on its own....In my opinion...too many mistakes have been made on this problem with not enough thought gone into it...I also need an opionion here?Lady00712/11/07ALL    http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/doctoring1.htmlCORRUPT PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

These drug combinations shrank the tumors of nearly half the women (45%) treated. In contrast	 less than one third (29%) of those women who received chemotherapy alone had a similar response. When Herceptin was added to the chemotherapy	 it boosted survival by an average of 5 months compared to chemotherapy alone.A small number of the women taking the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin had significant heart problems	 including congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump effectively. Adriamycin was blamed for most of this effect. Herceptin on its own rarely causes heart damage. But the two drugs given together resulted in more heart damage than expected. For this reason	 the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin is no longer recommended.Navelbine chemotherapy combined with Herceptin has also been studied recently in clinical trials.----------------------------------------------Serious heart side effectsResearch News:Preliminary results from the HERA Trial: Herceptin Taken Less Frequently at Higher Doses Does Not Increase Risk of Heart Damage Less commonly	 Herceptin can damage the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Find out more about the benefits and side effects of Herceptin. Rarely (about 5% of the time)	 the heart damage is bad enough that women experience stroke or life-threatening congestive heart failure_  À_a condition in which the heart can't pump effectively. Slightly more often (about 7% of the time)	 Herceptin causes mild heart failure.Women who experience mild or more serious heart damage can stop taking Herceptin and start taking heart-strengthening medications. This often brings heart function back to normal.While heart damage can be more severe when Herceptin is given along with other chemotherapy drugs known to cause heart damage	 including Adriamycin (chemical name: doxorubicin) and possibly other drugs like it.Taking Herceptin with the chemotherapy drug Taxol (chemical name: paclitaxel) does not increase your risk of severe heart damage. Studies have shown that this combination causes only slightly more mild heart damage than Herceptin alone. Women in clinical trials who are receiving Herceptin plus Taxol are being watched very closely for this effect.Testing your heart before and during Herceptin treatmentBefore starting Herceptin therapy	 you should have an echocardiogram or a MUGA scan to check how well your heart is functioning.An echocardiogram uses sound waves to take detailed pictures of the heart as it pumps blood.

post_4000318	post_1389082	"If you feel light headed in hot water then you may have low blood pressure or low salt intake.If you feel fatigued/exhausted after a shower	 no matter the temperature	 then you are probably sensitive to the chlorine and/or fluoride added to the water. These are toxins	 easily absorbed through the skin. Essentially	 you are being poisoned when you step into the shower. You probably do not have enough iodine in your diet	 because chlorine and fluoride are chemically very similar to iodine and your thyroid cannot tell the difference. So they replace iodine in your thyroid causing hypothyroidism.As a side note	 countries with fluoride in their water do not have less cavities than countries without it. Fluoride was used to control populations in Nazi concentration camps & Russian gulags because it causes fatigue and lowers IQ. The only reason it's added to the water is because it's a byproduct of weapons manufacturing and they have nowhere else to put it. It is likely the cause of Fibromyalgia and contributes to many cancers (see the rate of breast cancer in US versus countries without fluoridated water)."	1

post_8134470	post_1389082	I personally think its a body wash or shampoo. I started using a certain body wash and had these problems now ive stopped and it doesnt happen anymore! What body wash or shampoo do you use? Maybe one of those ingredients is setting this off.	0

post_8230266	post_1389082	"i think honestly it's that (if your tired this is) that your body relaxes heaps and if your already tired it starts to go asleep on you. I told my parents they thought nothing of it. I used to sway and have to lean against the wall and then I'd be unsure how long I'd been there for	 feeling disorientated and lol but mentally slow. I've passed out about twice after showering.    I don't think it can be in this many peoples heads."	0
post_8297600	post_1389082	the same thing happened to me today except i passed out right after showering and didn't know how long i was out for. This is the first time it has happened to me so hopefully it won't again but if it does i will go to the doctor and get checked out. I was thinking it was the face wash that i use but i am not sure. i guess i will see what happens tomorrow when i shower.

post_8398735	post_1389082	"I went to the doctor because not only do I get lightheaded and nauseous after my shower and have to lie down	 I sometimes get it first thing after I get out of bed and have to lie on the floor until it passes!    I started taking my blood pressue at home and it has been in the 80's over 50's when I'm feeling really bad	 and 90's over 50's when I'm just a little lightheaded. The doctor sent me to a cardiologist and he said to ""just increase the salt in your diet""! They seem to feel it is just ""low blood pressure"" and that it won't hurt me. Yikes! Not sure what else to do about it except increase my fluid intake and salt...haven't noticed much difference	 though."	0
post_8401235	post_1389082	"The same thing happens to me	 so mow I take tepid showers.Thins is what I was told.Best Answer - Chosen by AskerHot showers (any heat really) dilate (open up) the blood vessels in an attempt to bring down body temperature.Excessive or rapid dilation can lead to a drop in blood pressure	 which sounds like what you experienced. Some other signs on sudden hypotension (low blood pressure) include sweating	 nausea	 vomiting	 tunnel vision	 ringing in ears or sounds appearing far away	 lightheadedness	 feeling dizzy and fainting.This hypotension can also happen if you stand up too quickly from a sitting or lying down position	 and can be prevented by getting up slowly. This is called postural hypotension and can be made worse by things such as a hot shower	 as this will further drop blood pressure.When you feel an episode coming on	 lie down	 or sit with your head between your knees to aid the return of blood and vital oxygen to your brain. Fainting can cause serious injuries.Also try having a cooler shower. Cold constricts blood vessels.Source(s):Registered nurse2 years ago Report Abuse"	0
post_8451361	post_1389082	"It is not in your head.    This happens to a lot of people	 me included.    I think it may have something to do with the temperature of the water.    You need to get a new doctor if this is all she can manage when you go to her with a concern."	0
post_8491159	post_1389082	"This can also be caused by steam... not just the hot water.    Anyone suffering from this should make sure their shower is properly vented by opening a window/door or turning on the exhaust fan.

post_8348677	post_8348436	"Sorry to hear about your problem	 but I think you've come to the right place for help!If your problem centers on gas	 or includes same	 you should also check out this gas forum:http://************/forums/f.asp?f=357Constant gas or frequently malodorous stools often indicate a bacterial imbalance or infection in the gut. A comprehensive stool analysis should help a lot.since your issue is a matter of anal odor	 I've heard that some folks have success using those individually foil packed antibacterial wipes a few times a day	 and certainly after bowel movements. I've seen these at drug stores. I've also read about someone who very successfully used underarm stick deodorant in that region	 (Not an antiperspirant	 as these simply block pores with aluminum or other compounds -- you'd specifically be looking for an ANTIBACTERIAL with a compound such as triclosan or equivalent.) I've seen a heavy cream deodorant called ""Tussy"" that might be very effective as well	 although not as convenient as a stick deodorant -- you might give that a try.I'd highly recommend you consult with your doctor abouta comprehensive stool analysis . Some other labs do stool analyses too	 but sometimes they're not as competent or their reports don't include the all-important bacterial and yeast cultures. You'll want to see what imbalances might be present and go from there. I also suggest probiotics"	1

post_16766	post_14715	"*continuing from what I previously said because it wouldn't let me finish the rest*Anyways	 I have three questions. 1. Does anxiety cause a burning sensation throughout your body? 2. Can regular blood tests tell if you have diabetes? I even was checked for billirubin *which is about the liver* and they told me everything was fine and I think your liver would be messed up if you had diabetes right? 3. Does anyone here that has anxiety attacks ever feel extremely weird and not real? I feel real but it just seems odd. Like I always think something is wrong with my head because I feel like im out of it but im not. Kinda misplaced feeling. It's just weird.Also	 I'm a 20 year old female. 5'1"" 118	 and am fairly active. Diabetes does not run in my family	 nor does any other disease. Am I just being too paranoid?"	0

I've had extensive tests with a Neurologist (nerve/muscle testing) &    Neuroseurgeon (MRI's	 bloodwork	 you name it).They ruled out diabetes	 thyroid disease	 autoimmune diseases	 anti-inflammatory diseases.

I had it in my back the other night	 I could feel it more when I was laying down. Right now I have it in my head. It's a pretty scary feeling. I did not know what was wrong with me and made the mistake by looking it up online. I found that muscle twitching could be a sign of MS	 ALS	 and Parkinson's disease. That was all I needed to here.

They took my blood and ran tests and said that I was suffering from anxiety. My dr said the same thing when I went to see him a few weeks ago. For some reason I did not believe him and still thought I was suffering from a brain tumor or some other neurological disorder. I was also having heard palpitations and my heart rate would reach 120 at times. I had an ekg and wore a heart monitor and my heart is normal. The worst thing you can do is look up illnesses online. Take it from experience. I use to do the same thing and all it did was make my anxiety worse. If you didnt' think you had the disease before reading it you will after. I recently started taking medication for anxiety and feel it has helped a bit. I don't feel as nervous and I stopped looking up illnesses online. But just know that your not alone and you have every symptom of anxiety. The worst thing is I didn't even know I had anxiety so it was hard to listen to some doctor tell me this.

post_3571908	post_14715	Wow I am really glad to read eveyone's comments on here...I actually got off my Zoloft about 2 moths ago and then all of a sudden started getting pain in my neck and back spreading down my arms and then to my legs I am getting cramps and tingling/burning.    I consider myself an expert health anxiety searcher and first had myself convinced due to the neck pain going down my arms that I had a tumor in my neck.    Then when the leg thing started I had myself convinced I had a blood clot.    Now I am having the burning all over and have researched so indepth that I have figured out that I must have a tumor called adenoma on my parathyroid gland causing my body not to absorb calcium and magnesium.    I have been taking supplements but the funny thing is doc already checked my thyroid...so dont know why I am trying to diagnose myself.    I am really glad everyone here has had the burning all over though cause that was my next search...I think I need to get back on the zoloft but I dont want to cause I lost 15 lbs getting off of it.    I know that sounds horrible but it makes me really fat and right now I am at 115 and 5'1 so it is so perfect!!Question does anyone else have the burning all day or is it just when your having an anxiety attack?Also I clench at night and I know alot of my neck and shoulder and headache symptoms are due to that just cant control my thoughts from thinking it is something worse.    Is health anxiety a form of OCD cause I have noticed once I start I cant make myself stop!	0

post_4138091	post_14715	"Like you	 I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one suffering this very painful burning. I just recently experienced the burning in the past week or so. It started in my feet and now it's moved into my knees. It kept me up all night last night. I know that	 like every other average American	 I've experienced stress. More so now than ever. I always felt like I could survive it. I've had multiple surgeries including a double mastectomy for breast cancer. So	 I think I've done well in handling stress but after reading everyone's comments I may have to revisit that. I've been in such pain that I felt like I needed to go to the emergency. I've never been treated for any type of nerve disfunction	 stress	 or anything of that nature but it may be time.    I'll let you know what the doctor says.My pain is frequent but not continuous. It burns as though I've been bitten by a bee but when I look there's nothing there and it's extreme pain! :(    Thanks for sharing	 I'll keep in touch. Elaine"	0

post_4338294	post_14715	"Hi	It been a year since my dad passed away. I have not seen him for approximatley eight    ( as a result of migration) years though we had very regular contacts. He was a loving DAD. His passing and my never seeing him again has brought on tremendous stress and thus stress symptoms. I attend his furneral and after I have returned to uk from the caribben I commence to feel the most bezzard	 mind recking symptoms.First it was small burning all over as small as the eye of a needle radiating from right side face	 scalp with just my left shoulder muscle the entire shoulder muscle.Them spasms undulating thoughtout my body    and now along with the spasms and burning is pain. The pain writhe through my body like the spasms which now has seemed to surpass the spasms. The pain only lasted a split second and move on to somewhere else. In previous months I have had a few days almost pain or symptom free and then close to menstrating it commences again.The calf of my feel at times feel tired from spasms and pain for a few days and then th a relief intersect.Striking face	 head and neck pain	 a buzzing sound in my right ear that lasted a few second and over a days period. Spasms everywhere sparodictly but not so severe now.I have convinced myself as most people mentioned of terrible sickness (we alway think of the worst in situations like these).It is so debilitating and continous over a year now.I have been to the doctors and six occasions	 seeing four different GPs	 taking all the blood test heshe could think of relating to my symptioms and all returned negative.I have not done anything nuero yet.There is no deteriorating physical imparement other than the symptoms mentioned. I am of the belief that this could be stress as I have noticed individuals mentioning similar burning everywhere and spasms so I believe as long as any potential problems is ruled out by your GPs the symptoms could stress. If anyone feels pain anywhere on there body	 this include head	 face neck	 back	 thights	 legs	 fingers	 wrist	 hand and very much everywhere from a short duration please let me know. thank you very much.JacI am trying to relieve stree with music and exercises	 eat as best possible as anyone can and take a health supliment this might start the road to recovery. Stay positive even in difficult times and be optimistic that the furture has somethning in store. Hope this helps."	0

post_4648687	post_14715	"hello	i    suffered an anxiety attack for the first time two weeks ago. i have been in and out of the doctors as well this past two weeks. they told me it was just a panic attack but they would not explain to me the reason	 cause	 or how to treat it	 and fast. first they gave me an inhaler and benadril. after that	 lorazepam and after that i was given lexapro that did me no good that just make me more depressed. I have heard of the burning sensation everyone has been feeling. i feel it	 it starts on the back of my head and works it's way down my neck	 back and both arms. i went to the doctor for this and they said it was just my nerves and that i was getting a fever. oh wow	 i said	 that sure did not help. now i know it is anxiety related	 but what does the fever have to do with it?    this past two weeks have been the worsest in my life. i lay in bed all day and i have four kids that are also worried for me apart from my husband that's driving him nuts cause he does not know what to do. today my family in arizona have decided to come and pick me up	 i live in las vegas nevada. hopefully i will get better for my family knows exactly what i'm going thru cause my father went thru the same with his dipression and all. i know they can help me and my husband agrees. i just want to get better. i have lost 15 pounds in two weeks	 i have an eating disorder now. i have trouble eating anything that is solid	 it gets me nauseated and i want to vomit	 but because of what i have read	 it is all anxiety caused. i never knew how i got it cause two weeks ago we were on our way to arizona to spend some time with my family when it happened. i was not thinking much of anything and me and my husband were having a good conversation on how much fun we will have once we got there. I really want to keep in touch with everyone cause i know you are going thru the same thing as i am. it really helps to be around someone who knows and have felt what i have been thru.

post_5122234	post_14715	"Hello. I am a 27 year old female that has had anxiety and panic attacks for awhile now. I first went on zoloft back in 2002 and after about three weeks of continual meds	 I started to feel normal again. I then decided to take myself off of the zoloft because I did not like the thought of being on ""the happy pill"" or even depending on it to feel ""normal"" again. I lost my father in 2005 and dealt with a lot of stress and sadness at that time and had to go back on the zoloft. Again	 after a few weeks started to feel better so went off the medication	 which I have heard and read that that is a bad thing to do. It is now 2009 and almost a month ago I had a terrible spell of vertigo. I went to the doctor and she said that it was a sinus infection and that one of my ears needed to be cleaned	 which they did in the office with a water machine	 peroxide and a pick that shoots a steady stream of liquid for about 5 minutes or so. The doctor also asked how things were at home and at work. I told her that I have been stressed and that my BP was really high when the nurse checked it. She then put me on Toprol for my heart rate and BP	 zoloft (the generic brand) and Omnicef for the sinus infection. Now this appointment was on Fri Oct 30th	 and by that Monday night I woke up feeling anxious	 dry heaving	 and like my body was on fire. I went and woke up a family member and was scared	 crying	 felt like I was dying. It finally went away after about 15 minutes and after that episode I was exhausted. When I woke up I felt like I had been beaten. I then called my doctors office thinking that I had an allergic reaction to one of the meds or a combination of them but my doctor was out	 so I took an appointment with another doctor there and he didnt check anything. All he did was up the does of my bp meds and write a new script for a higher dose. I did not like that at all	 so I called another doctor	 an internal doctor and got an appointment. She checked me thoroughly and saw that my bp and heart rate were elevated so she took me off of everything and did a script for ativan until my blood work and urinalysis came back. A week later I went for a follow up and she placed me on a bp med that had a side effect of scalp tingling. I am really sensitive to meds apparently	 and I couldnt take it. She put me on another med and it seems to be good	 although I have to take it 3 times a day. She also	 put me back on the zoloft and I started to have adverse reactions. While I was out I had a horrible panic attack and had to leave the salon that I was at. I then had another that Sunday. Called the nurse and the doctor called back and told me to try paxil. Well	 I started yesterday and about 5 pm. I got up feeling anxious and started to have the on fire feeling	 sweating	 but yet my skin felt cold. My heart rate was through the roof	 so once I calmed down and stopped crying I took an ativan. My liver enzymes were elevated so I had an ultrasound done to that area this past Tuesday and it came back that I had a dense liver? Not sure what the next step is	 but I am not a smoker or drinker	 and wonder why me? My panic disorder is getting the best of me and I cant function away from home :(It seems as if all of the medication is having an adverse reaction and I dont know what to think. Any advice? I know that we all just wish to feel ""normal"" again. I guess it just takes time. Breathe and God Bless!!"	0

post_5190653	post_14715	"Oh my Gosh!! You guys all sound like me!! I also go crazy all over the internet researching all my symptoms. I have the burning sensation all throughout my body	 scalp	 skin and even my insides. I was also convinced that I had either a Brain Tumor or MS and I actually did have an MRI (had panic attacks every day while waiting for the results) which came back all normal. But the burning sensation is still there and it scares me. I know that what we all need to do is just tell ourselves that it is all caused by panic and forget all about it. Forget all the symptoms	 forget all the internet research and try to live life as normally as possible. Reading all your posts has been so reassuring to me because I know there are others out there struggling with the same thing. ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself"". What is making all of us ill is our fear and I believe all symptoms will disappear once we learn not to be afraid of fear (or the next panic attack). Even if we never get rid of our fear and must live our whole lives with this	 each day that goes by is one more day that went by and guess what: we are still alive	 nothing bad happened to us	 we didn't go crazy.

I haven't heard anyone else say this but mine always happen when I am settling down for the night and then I don't want to go to sleep because I think I'm going to die in my sleep. Right now I am experiencing a burning sensation that feels like sunburn and won't go away!I wish this nightmare would end. I don't want to be on medication again. I    would like to enjoy life again."	0

post_5558646	post_14715	"I have read almost everyone's comments and could not almost believe that i once suffered from almost every feeling tha is described here. I am now free from anxiety due to trusting in God's word which says ""For God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind"" 2 Timothy verse 7. I sometimes feel the anxiety trying to come back but I say thank you Lord for delivering me from these things and the feeling of passing out and fear goes away. I had someone from my church tell me to say the verses    over and over and the devil has no choice but to flee...Keep believing that the Lord's word works and you will be free from this."	0

post_5666910	post_14715	"i too was feeling the same way... one morning i woke up and had really bad neck pain	 i could barely move my head to one side. i started working on my computer and my right hand started to fall asleep. my friend called me and i told him about my hand and he got me all worried and said i need to monitor that. i think he made me have a panic attack because all of a sudden i felt tingly and numb on my face	 was having trouble breathing and started stuttering. i called 911 cuz i thought i was having a stroke. they came and calmed me down and assured me it was not. i went to the ER later and they took xrays	 found nothing and told me it was a panick attack	 gave me some ibuprofen 600 and muscle relaxer and sent me home. after that	 i kept feeling all the sensations (tingling	 numbness	 strange headaches like tingling in my brain or clenching up	 and nausea) and got really worried that i had ms. i am a 29 yr old female and pretty active and healthy so all of this really made me depressed and more worried. i got a physical with blood work and everything came out very good. i pad a visit to a regular doc and paid 200$ for 20 min of his time and he said to go to physical therapy which was 75$ a sessions! so i never followed thru with that. i dont have health insurance and got an exam thru a friend from a spinal specialist	 who didnt run any tests but said i had carpel tunnel in my right hand and inflammation of my muscles in my upper back and to take ibuprofen 600 religiously 3 times a day for 10 days straight to help the inflammation. i felt relief from him telling me i was ok and not to worry. i hate taking pills so i didnt follow his orders. i felt good for 2 wks then woke up one morning feeling very nauseous and the symptoms came back. so then i decided to do what he said and taking all those pills didnt help much	 except make me feel naseous and worried that i was taking way too many pills. finally	 i went to a chiropractor. he couldnt believe how inflammed and out of place my upper back felt. he took a nerve test and xrays and showed me that i had a loss of curviture in my upper neck and that my nerves were being compressed. he assured me that i dont have anything wrong with my brain and i am not a candidate    for ms because of my age and how healthy and active i am. i have been seeing him twice a week for about 4 wks now and i feel much much better. all of the symptoms have been tapering off. not to mention that i feel more energetic and also stopped drinking coffee because it made my symptoms worse. the chiro feels very confident that after about 6-8 wks of treatment my symptoms will be completely gone. he also said that alot of my tension comes from stress and to just relax and do anything to help me relax- light yoga	 acupuncture	 going to the spa	 and if i get a massage	 get a light one just to stimulate the muscles because i am still a little inflammed. reading all these posts and finding that alot of people had mris and ct scans done and everything came back normal has made me feel a lot better. the chiro gave me a referral to mri just because i was so worried about it and for a piece of mind. i have not gotten it done tho because i feel much better. has anyone been to a chiropractor after all of those tests? if not	 i would suggest you go to one and get your spine checked. make sure it was a good reputable one and that    they do xrays tho. hope this helps! :)also	 a friend of mine suggested i read this book: healing back pain- the mind body connection by john sarno... talks about how the mind effects back pain and other ailments."	1
post_5705273	post_14715	"For like a year now I have been experiencing all of these symptoms.    I have a burning sensation throughout my body and I feel like I am going to die	 and reading all of these comments makes me feel more comfortable and not alone.    I have had many anxiety attacks in the past year where I just all of sudden get dizzy	 and I also exaggerate every little single pain in my body and make it out to be something drastic.    I have gone to a psychiatrist and he has me taking clonazopam and klonopin which has seemed to help a little bit but not drastically. The klonopin just helps me when I have an attack and it pretty much calms me down.    I am just glad that all these symptoms are normal for other people experiencing anxiety	 and I am going to try much harder to just think happy thoughts and enjoy    life.    I am going to see a therapist in a couple weeks to talk out all these problems that I am having to maybe see if I can stop it and how it all started.    I will be checking back here frequently to read everyones comments	 so hopefully I will not have to think I have to go to the ER over an anxiety attack."	0
post_5747620	post_14715	"Hello everyone		 My name is Shan an i too have been living with anxiety and panic for a long time	 mine started when my mom and brother passed away and went through a divorce in between.. My mother died alone at home	 we found her in the bathroom floor and by brother died on the road in a horrible big truck accident. So naturally I took on the every little thing that happened to my body I was afraid I too was dying.    After many trips to the ER and being hospitalized I was diaganosed with a MVP. The doctor was great and explained to me that	 that itself can cause anxiety and panic attacks	 unfortuanantly I was not able to take the meds for that... so I go to my gp	 and I was over weight I had had a baby and still had not lost the weight and he explained to me that being overweight can cause this issue to so he put me on prozac	 xanax	 a diet pill and a diuretic.. so for the next few months I did not know if i was coming or going	 I would be out at three in the morning washing the car cleaning etc. I never slept.. and i was losing 15 pounds a week			 i got so small that i looked anorexic and still had panic attacks. so after a while i started taking more and more xanax and got really addicted to them to the point that i was taking a months supply in about a week and a half and then bumming off of other people that had them and going to the emergency room.. Finally once i was in a rage a went to the emergency room and they told me that if i took one more i would die and they were suprised i was still alive now. so i go to rehab and got put on Klonopine....when i came out of rehab i was pissed and decided i was not going to live this way anymore. so i started doing things that scarred me alone 				 until i realized hey i am still alive		 and one day they were gone and i have been panic free for ten years up until 2006. then they came back again. and here we go again			 this time it was my gall bladder and after they took out my gallbladder i was once again fine until 2009. My best friend and boyfriends step son passed away	 my job very stressful and my 18 yr old daughter became the nightmare from hell... i lost my hair and the whole nine yards				my symptoms are different this time 				 all the same old ones but new ones too				 like the hair loss	 the tremors	 and i shake upon waking now	 and it feels like my blood sugar is low and etc.    I too have done alot of research and i am sure that some of this u have already figured out		 but some illnesses and infection in the body can cause anxiety for people who r prone to it and fear or death can set them off and so can some meds	 like cold medicines and breathing treatments	 and inhalers etc.    but one day when i was having an episode in the store 		 this great lady that helped me explained alot too. like if u have had a surgery and u have scar tissue and it gets the nerves trapped in the scar tissue can cause it too	 and if ur body is out of alignment that can trigger it as well. so not really sure of what she told me 			 i was to the point of hey i will try anything except drugs 			 i wont do that again			 and i will be damned if after one visit to the chiro if i did not feel great... ur body can get out of alignment because of injurys or poor posture or scoliose	 etc	 and sometimes that make ur spine press on the nerves in a bad way				 and believe it or not ur nerves control alot of things	 so just a thought 	 also i heard accupuncture helps and like the rubber band issue	 when i feel an attack coming on instead of reaching for a pill i sit down and i write	 about everything that is bothering me and by the time i am done my panic attack is gone		and then i throw the paper away	also healthy snacking helps		 when u eat and ur body starts to digest it has something else to focus on for awhile like digestion 		 so i keep alot of fruit and nuts and beef jerky and pop corn on hand and it does not take much to throw ur body in digestion mode. so i hope it helps"	1
post_5774267	post_14715	"From what I read here I to believe I am having anxiety problems. From what I can remember it may have started late last year always worried about something. Something happen in the beginning of this year to where I had a fear of moving	 where am I going to live	 how am I going to pay rent and everything else like that. Well in May those fears came to reality with a eviction notice. Ever since then I have been worse then I have ever been in life. I could not sleep and if I did it was a few hours	 my insides where feeling all jittery	 I could not sit still	 I was feeling like I should of been doing something but there was nothing I could do	 I was not eating and ended up losing 10lbs in 2 weeks. I was in and out of a bath atleast 5 times a day for that helped me a little.	 before all this I was seeing a therepist but was really scared to call him for I did not want to end up in the hospital thinking that will just make matters worse. I was a wreck.Now for the present day	 my doctor put me on depression pills and that seems to help just a little. we are still facing the eviction and I still have the fears of where to go with my kids	 how to pay rent	 since right now I am living in a place where it is based on income	 and everything else. I have turned my life to god and my mind is a little bit more stable then it was however now I am experiencing something new. and that is the burning sensation. last night it was going across my chest and today it is in the upper part of my arms. I was woundering if anxiety could be playing a part in this that is when I came across this website and realized that something more is not wrong with me. I feel in my heart now that I need help in more ways then one. I Pray to god to make thing better."	0

post_5920894	post_14715	"I would just like to say that I strongly believe that alot of the people on this internet forum (including myself) are bored and discontent with their lives	 and they have nothing better to do than obsessively look up random problems on the internet	 then convince themseleves that they have the certain issue	 therefore the people's bodys begin to physiologically FEEL the symptoms/problems. It's an honest answer	 however	 it is strange that we still continue this behavior after many have ruled out that NOTHING is wrong! Lack of contentment with life=need to stir up problems=need to worry=Generalized Anxiety Disorder. (one of the many psychological possibilities) I do believe that us women have the 'anxiety problem' worse	 because throughout our worries we soon wonder if we are pregnant.    The endless online questions and information overload-lead us to wasting hours of each day researching interesting topics and convincing ourselves that we have these issues	 when in reality-we're fine. My suggestion is to take some natural Melatonin	 pray that God helps you and your madness and go to sleep."	1
post_5920929	post_14715	"I would also like to add	 that I am not trying to attack/condemn ANYBODY for their physical/emotional feelings. Because I know	 they are very VERY real	 and incredibly scary. Infact they can get downright debilitating depending on the situation. I do think that STRESS has a HUGE impact on our bodies/minds	 and it can create some very horrific sensations and ideas which drives us crazy. Also the stress induces insomnia-because we want an answer	 some form of instant gratification to know that there is SOMEONE else OUT there who feels the exact same way. The insomnia then leads to sleep deprivation which can totally WRECK HAVOC on your LIFE. Then it becomes a vicious cycle-you still research new symptoms	 trying to get to the bottom of 'what is wrong with you' determined to find the answer (*before you die*). The more you research-the more sleep deprived you get-the worse your 'symptoms' become	 and then    you begin to experience true symptoms. My personal physical problems: dizziness	 feeling like I am going to blackout when I stand up	 headache	 IRRITABILITY	 wierd sensations in my calf muscles	 cold feet	 back pain & clumsiness. Mentally: forgetfulness	 lack of short term memory	 social anxiety	 inability to focus despite being on medication for A.D.D. fear that I am walking on egg shells with everyone around me	 untrusting of anyone	 and possibly paranoid schizophrenia	 aspergers and/or autism. I hope that this maddening information overload truely helps someone out there-to know that alot of people are paralyzed by these unrealistic fears. We are characters of habit and many times we are trapped in our self-created prisons. TIME FOR A VACATION!"	0
post_5947573	post_14715	"Hello all. I hope that I can be a help to you	 as you have been to me. I've suffered from axiety since I can remember. I've always been a very ""nervous"" person and always worrying constantly about the littlest things in life. I started getting panic attacks constantly back in 2007 after I had a car wreck. I went months without eating hardly anything (got down to 98 lbs) and feeling like I wasn't even real. I thought something was wrong with my head	 brain tumor	 cancer	 etc. I finally convienced my dad to take me to the ER because of the fear i had a tumor and was dying	 they ran a CTC scan and everything was fine. I finally went to the doctor and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. I was put on antidepressants and other med. for my panic attacks	 which seemed to help	 however I felt like I had NO personality at all so I stopped taking them. Ever since I've been suffering on and off with panic attacks and general anxiety all the time. I always worry about my health and dying and I even get online and start looking up my symptoms and trying to find a cause	 which only causes more attacks. I'm just soooo sick and tired of living every day thinking somethings wrong and always suffering from anxiety	 but it does feel good to know that i am not alone in this world. Recently i've been taking valerian root for my anxiety and it seems to help ease it. I just wish I was normal and even after I've suffered this long with axiety I still always fear that there is something more wrong than just anxiety...

post_6174363	post_14715	"I have also had issues with anxiety	 exacerbated by ptsd from Somalia	 and through an unfortunate visit to my dentist where I was overdosed on Fluoride during a regular cleaning I learned that Fluoride is a substance that makes my problems worse and very well may be the main cause of my mental issues. It took me over two years to figure it out though because the doctors I went to all disregarded any true physical symptoms and wrote off everything as anxiety. I did everything they said took most of what they told me to and things just got worse so i got off the psych drugs and really started paying attention to what caused my symptoms to get worse. I knew the major physical and mental degradation kicked off just after my dental appointment so i narrowed in on possible bacterial infection from deep cleaning	 mercury exposure from filings being cleaned	 and the fluoride tray treatment that the hygienist did wrong ( she put 100 x the amount she was supposed to and it filled my mouth. I also learned that they had just started fluoridation of our water in my area and I had been drinking	 cooking	 bathing	 washing hands in 1 ppm water. I stopped using F toothpaste	 stopped using the water and drank distilled water. I started to feel better. then I saw a commercial for green tea and how good it is for you	 so I made    a pot. I felt like I was hit by a train the symptoms came back so quickly. It turns out that tea has up to 6 ppm of fluoride naturally. So i started researching other food that may have "" natural"" F content. I cut those out too even though nearly everything has F in it so i stay away from the ones with high F levels. In this way I discovered that it was Fluoride that either caused my problems ( as it is an accumulative poison that builds up in your body year after year) or at least it causes my problems to get worse when I consume it or am exposed to it.    After 2 1/2 years of my learned Dr's telling me that fluoride and the dental appt had nothing to do with my symptoms I finally was refer ed to a Dr who actually realizes that fluoride is a very poisonous toxin ( rated    between lead and arsenic) He has put me on Lugols iodine ( starting at 1/4 of a drop a day!) which causes the F in the soft tissues to be displaced and eventually excreted although the F in my bones Will be there forever as it binds to calcium. I am feeling better even though some of the physical and emotional issues resurface if too much gets released at once.    Just to warn you 	 98% of the doc and dentists will tell you F is safe	 there are many sites on the web	 fluoride deception	 fluoride action network	 etc... Too bad we only look for information when it is too late to prevent damage.    Just an interesting bitmof info	 most of the psych drugs have their dumbimg down	 anestitizing effect through the use of Fluoride : prozac	 zoloft	 paxil	 etc.."	1

I find myself taking showers at night to help calm me down. Once I get out of the shower and lay down it helps for a little bit then my mind will start to panic and my heart will start racing and I even gag alot. I am very worried to go to the doctor for fear that there maybe something really wrong with me and then the heart starts pounding again.

post_6513074	post_14715	I have been suffering with panic attacks for the last couple of months been to the ER about 4 times and have had every heart exam available. You name it I have had it.    They all came back clear. Before being discharged the conversation always went back to anxiety depression and panic attacks. Well I have had several panic attacks and they are no fun. I have been taking xanax and paxil. I also had an upper edoscopy done yesterday and was told that I have minor erosion in my stomach and some other minor abnormalities still waiting for biopsy results to come back. I'm in major pain all over my body and the stress of the waiting period for the biopsy results has triggered several attacks. I have become very dull always want to be in bed and very short fused it has affected my family life and my wife doesn't know what else to do. I am so afraid of death that It has ruined my life . I just want my life back. Haven't been to work in over a month. I need some help. This is not fun at all.

Started out as burning feeling around collarbone and then down through sternum area.    Does not feel like heartburn	 tender when touching. Ocassionally I will get it in my lower legs as well. I also pain behind my left shoulder blade	 sensation of hair or something in throat	 a dull burning type sensation in armpits	 tendon (maybe joint) pain in wrists/ankles	 abdominal tightness on both sides	 and discomfort in shins.

When one of these symptoms starts to increase intensity it seems like they all do.I have had EKG	 Stress Chest	 Echocardiogram	 Chest CT	 CT head	 MRI Brain	 Bone Scan	 Upper Endoscopy	 Colonoscopy	 Abdominal MRI and number of blood tests (CBC	 Iron	 B-12	 autoimmune	 vit-D	 Lyme	 etc)..all unremarkable.    I have seen an ENT	 Gastroenterologist	 Neurologist	 Rheumatologist	 and ongoing visits with family doctor; however	 still nothing.    Anyone have something similar or any suggestions on where I can go from here?    After so many months I am about to give up and just accept I have to live with this; however	 I keep thinking I want to keep digging in case something serious.    Like others I have thought I had MS	 brain tumors	 cancer	 etc.    I am getting a lot of anxiety over all these symptoms.    I noticed a lot of people are taking medicine to treat anxiety and wondering if I should try that to see if helps.    I don't ""feel anxious"" but guess it can be subconscious.    What medicine do you take and does it seem to relive all symptoms when on it?    Is the medicine addicting?"	0
post_6687035	post_14715	"Well i Was doing pretty good for a while	 I even returned back to work after a two month leave. Because of the type of work I do	 I came off of the meds cold turkey. Everything was fine until last week I started feeling a very severe pain on my left side once again which I think never Actually went away. So I called my Dr and he agreed to order an ultrasound of my abdomen	 which off course came back normal. My body is in constant pain and my Dr pretty much told me that he has tested everything he could possibly test and that he wasn't ordering anymore. He told me to continue with my medicine and setting up an appointment in the near future. I personally not convinced I have chronic pain and I could hardly move. I have severe abdominal-rib-kidney pain on my left side. I haven't been back to work in a week and probably in danger of looking my job. So yeah my life isn't fun. I'm at the end of the rope and don't really feel like fighting anymore	 I have also been having some weird dreams that have resulted in some panick attack in my sleep. My wife and kids are just watching me deteriorate and can't get me to get out of bed. Haven't left my bedroom in over 5 days. My Dr even suggested checking into a mental institution. LOL. I know that their is something more than anxiety. I believe that my pain and the fact that I haven't been diagnosed with anything concrete is causing my depression. Just feel like giving up. Thanks for you response	 my email is jgnz721atgmail.com so my fight still continues I will not stop until I find out what this pain is all about."	0

Certain movements bring on the burning too. my doctor so far has ordered a MRI	 nerve coduction test ( electrodes and needles) . Initially he said it was Fibromyalgia. No blood work has been done but I think thats next. And lately I have been very dizzy feeling too. I would really like to know what is going on with me.

Here the thing though I do have a sickness I have a small tumor in my liver that doesnt effect my liver function cause my liver enzymes are perfect couldnt be better. Everythig else is great too nothing else is wrong with me. I'm awaiting my scan results should know by tomorrow is its gone or not. I had radiation and chemo last month the entire month so it really kicked my *** and today I had a bad allergic reaction to CT Scan Dye. Ive had it a million times but this time I get a reaction. My heart felt like it was going to pound out of my chest it was awful. But now i'm a severe hypochodriac and rightfully so. Tonight is the worst symptom ive felt in a long long time. I feel chest pains	 leg pain whole body pain you name it i feel it. My doctors are always telling me to calm down cause they are taking good care of me and watching me like a hawk. I'm thinking this burning feeling maybe has something to do with the radiation or chemo or maybe it is anxiety. Ive been taking xanex every day for the past week not one day have i missed a panick attack and its never ever been this bad.

post_7171608	post_14715	"Hi Everyone	I've just found this website. I'm 43 ... and I've had OCD/Anxiety Disorder for over 20 years. I had my first anxiety attack in a while just 3weeks ago. It seems like ages since I last had one and I'd forgotten how awful there are. For me the actual attack last seconds but the symptomsseem to last for weeks. 3 weeks on I still feel ill ... I have all the symptoms you guys are writing about ... the weird burining senstaion ... allover my back	 down my legs and arms. Headaches. Tight chest and feelings of being short of breath. My heart feel like its punding so hard ... and yetI feel so un fit. Before the attack I went on a 40 mile bike ride ... which I loved .... now I don't think I could cycle a mile. Palpitations too.It's weird how the symptoms seem to fluctuate from day to day. Generally the symptoms seem to last a month or so ... then I might get another attack.These symptoms seem quite bad this time ... but that might be due to the fact that I haven't had an attack in a while and my body isn't used tothem. I'm going to the gym this lunchtime .... the first time in 3 weeks ... I don't feel up to it but I'm going to force myself. I think theexercise will help. Perhaps try a bike ride at the weekend. I was on prozac for 15 years ... I found that helped a lot with the OCD/Anxiety. I cameoff it 18 months ago. I think I will resist going back on it for now and see how it goes. Its also funny how I feel so annoyed with myself abouthaving the attack in the first place ... I feel I could have done better at preventing it ... does anyone else get those feelings? ... it makesthe symptoms all the harder to bear as I feel I inflicted them on myself. My wife wants me to see my GP but I feel that he won't understand ormaybe won't believe me when I describe all the symptoms. It's helped reading everyone else's posts on here ... hope this helps too."	0

post_7242392	post_14715	I think it varies from person to person how long the symptoms last after an anxiety attack. Mine seem to last about a month. Gradually getting better over that time ... although it might not be a linear improvement .. some days being better than other.It's just over a month since I had my last attack. I had some awful symptoms. I'm feeling better now although I am starting to get a few anxiety attacks. There seems to be a cognitive process going on ... I'm worried about getting another attack (and all the awful symptoms) and that in turn causes me to get attacks.I'm thinking of going back on the prozac for a while .... I've been off it for a couple of years but it's helped me in the past.It seems to be good at pulling me out of this current process that I'm in.Best wishes to everyone ... it does get better.	0
post_7255914	post_14715	Well its me again. I had another attack over the weekend and missed work yesterday. My arms legs and stomach feel like they are burning and when I lay down it feels like I have to catch my breath which leads to the heart racing again. My wife seems to think that it is self inflected but I am getting to the point that I think I am going to see my doctor. I am just so worried that I may become addicted to pills. You see I have a very addictive personality. I have seen many friends and family get addicted easily but I cant continue to keep going like this. It seems that these attacks are happening more and more often. Reading all of your blogs makes me feel so much better that I am not the only one. I am back to work today but my arms legs and stomach still feel like they are burning. Sunday night and last night I took a bunch of warm showers and tried to get myself to calm down but Im thinking a doctor visit is next. Does anyone know what I can expect. I hate needles and I know they are going to want me to do blood work. Yikes!	0

post_7333686	post_14715	No prozac isn't addictive although you can't come off it quickly. You need to gradually tail it off over several weeks.I've started back on 20mg. I think it's starting to work a bit.Last night I had a new symptoms that I'd never had before. My body was burning up. I thought it might have been a fever but I wasn't sweating. Was horrible. I could get comfortable in bed. I'd get too hot under the duvet and then get too cold out of it. Today I feel a bit flu-y.You have to be careful with drinking alcohol with prozac. Last weekend I drunk quite a bit and it seemed to affect me a lot more than usual. It can make you even louder than you would be normally.	0

post_7439661	post_14715	Further to my Oct 18 post....It turned out that the reason I was burning up wasn't because of anxiety it was because I had pneumonia.It goes to show how awful and how many are the symptoms associated with anxiety that you can mistake pneumonia for it.I spent 5 days in hospital.I'm fairly sure the anxiety attacks are to blame for me getting it. The anxiety can lower your immune levels in time.Anyway ... I'm back at work now and still taking the 60mg prozac.I'm not sure if it's working yet ... still getting the anxiety attacks ... it's all a matter of trying to control them. The ones that come out of blue are the worst. They seem to get you off guard.You have to be strong ... take each day at a time.I'm having lots of thoughts of dying ... like I won't live long etc.I will not be beaten though. :>	0

The only answer they give me is that my potassium is low and it has almost the same symptoms as an anxiety attack.. low potassium makes you have terrible mussel spasms.. and your heart is the biggest mussel in the body.. the chest pain hurts so bad that I cry at times.. but I am going through a pretty bad time right now and am very stressed out with financial and relationship problems..

Yesterday I felt the closest I did to feeling normal	 and I was confident that my sleep would be better last night	 but it was worse.    I'm in the process of seeking therapy	 but according to intake personnel it could take a month.    I don't know how much longer I can put up with this.    I'm wondering if I'm experiencing the ""paradoxical effect"" or SSRI's	 where serotonin in the brain is decreased instead of increased.

The initial studies were done in the late 1990s	 and a recent study (dating from this past summer) produced the same results as the original study.    The supplement	 which occurs normally in grain	 appears to assist chemotherapy treatments in fighting the cancer.Given the recent study	 your doctor or cancer treatment specialist will likely be able to assist you in finding the supplement and properly dosing yourself.

The reports specifically mentioned lung cancer and ovarian cancer as having improved treatment response.     That	 unfortunately	 is all that I recall	 and I did not cut the article out of the newspaper after I read it so I do not even know who released the study report nor do I know how the inositol hexaphosphate was administered.

post_1347529	post_1335756	"THIS POST CONTAINS A RESPONSE FROM A CANCER ORGANIZATION IN CANADA ON THE SUBJECT OF CELLULAR ZEOLITE - EVERYONE PLEASE READTom	 I read your message and I hope that you check back on this.    My Dad has stomach cancer too.    He had 95% of his stomach removed	 chemo	 & radiation.    Unfortunately	 it has reoccurred and his prognosis is a limited future.I have been researching this subject for awhile and the following site is the best I have come across so far.    It is:    http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/TypesofCancer/Stomach/default.htm.    This site stated things bluntly and logically.    My Dad's oncologist never told us that radiation treatment was	 ""of little value"" and ""The amount of radiation needed to eradicate the cancer is greater than the patient can tolerate""    (this quotes come directly from the website mentioned previously).I emailed this website and asked the following question:""My father had a gastrectomy and 6 months later	 after chemo (5FU) and radiation	 has been notified that a piece of his small intestine that was removed has the stomach cancer. I am looking for any advice or suggesstions for his care. I have run across a product called CELLULAR ZEOLITE	 it is being touted by health food persons as being able to activate the p21 gene to inhibit cancer growth. I am interested to know if you have any knowledge of this and its safety for a stomach cancer patient. I have read that the patient must drink plenty of water with the Zeolite.""This was the resonse I promptly received back from David Noble	Library/Cancer Information Centre	 BC Cancer Agency:""We are not aware of this product - cellular zeolite. We have run a search in Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database and have found no record of this therapy. The treatment must be considered an unconventional treatment which has not received adequate testing by evidence based methods	 if at all. We therefore do not recommend its use as a cancer treatment.""Now	 I do not post this to discourage others	 only to share my research.    Personally	 I am ready to try this product on my Dad.    Someone mentioned a website (http://www.cqs.com/zeolite.htm) that said that CELLULAR ZEOLITE will cause long-term cancer.    Well	 I did not interpret his article to say that it will cause long-term cancer.    He points out that mineral crystals have a long history of causing lung disease and apparently	 CELLULAR ZEOLITE is a mineral crystal.I also found a website (http://www.newstarget.com/015232.html)    that countered the discourageing points of the above mentioned website.    This website is very detailed article on NATURAL CELLULAR DEFENSE	 which is another ZEOLITE product that is manufactured by WAIORA.    This is a good site to read on how ZEOLITE works in the body.    But	 you have to balance its credibility with the fact that it appears that it might be an advertisement of sorts	 and maybe not written in an entirely objective point of view.    But	 to be honest I do not know the exact aim of the article (if it is to be informative or an advertisement) and the main website claims to be a ""daily news and commentary on natural health	 wellness	 planetary health and medicine.""Also	 I found a blog (http://jackson.mboffin.com/blogpost.aspx?id=1894) where a self-described practitioner of ""alternative"" health (nutritional therapy)	 said:""For instance	 did you know that if a person has blockages or significant dysfunction in the digestive/elimination pathways (stomach	 liver	 pancreas	 small intestine	 bowel)	 a detox protocol can actually make things worse?""So	 I am befuddled on whether to use this for my Dad or not.    Tom	 have you been able to try it with your father?    I would love to talk with you more on the subject of our fathers	 please feel free to email me at: ***@****."	1
post_1347597	post_1335756	"Hi bluetoee	Yeah	 I try to check this once or twice a week (but I check my emails at least every second day).It's clear that doctors only know about their conventional medicine. We asked everyone we came into contact with if they knew about Zeolite	 but they didn't. Another problem is that it's quite new	 so not many people know it. But vitamin B-17 and other products like U-Fn (supposed to be epsecially good for stomach cancer     http://www.naturodoc.com/library/detox/U-Fucoidan.htm     have been around for 50 or more years	 so they should be known to them.The Problem we see everywhere is that the Pharmaceutical have soooooo much power	 that they silence enyone who might stop them from making billions from the sale of Chemo etc. They can't patent apricot kernells (a very high source of natural vitamin B-17)	 so they can't make money from it. If everyone was able to prevention/cure cancer with alternative methods	 they would loose loads of money.One of the first pages you see when searching Cellular Zeolite in google is 'Don't eat Cellular Zeolite'	 but all it (and all doctors) say is that 'it hasn't been tested	 so it must be dangerous'. Cellular Zeolite has actually been tested by the FDA in the US (not on how effetive it is against cancer	 but that it's safe to consume). Just check the waiora webpage.Apperently there are many different types of zeolites (even asbestos is one)	 but I don't believe that anyone can say that they're all toxic. Anyway	 even if it causes another cancer in 10 or 20 years time	 that's another decade or two without it.I haven't heard about the 'detox making things worse'	 so I can't comment	 but the bottom line for me is that the research that has been done shows that it can be effective and NONE of the people who claim it to be toxic/ineffective have backed it up with any research.The only change my dad saw so far (in 1.5 weeks of taking it)	 is that he vomited up a yellow grainy substance one night. He hadn't eaten anything for about a week (he's on a feeding tube). But what he saw when he looked at the pictures of his cancer later that day from the Endoscopy a few weeks ago	 was that it looked exactly the same. So maybe he coughed up some dead cancer cells already. We won't know for sure until we get another endoscopy in another few weeks."	1
post_1347603	post_1335756	"Hey Tom I will check out the vitamin B-17.    I agree that the pharmaceutical companies are all powerful and block the medical world's ability to think out of the box.Please let me know how your Dad progresses as will I.    Since your Dad and you have had the courage to try the Zeolite	 I believe we will too.    I am just afraid to try something on my Dad that may aggravate his condition.    Were you guys instructed to drink plenty of water with the Zeolite?    I had read that you should somewhere.If you feel comfortable emailing me that would be great so we could keep in contact.

post_1347631	post_1335756	It seems to me that the medical profession in general would have us ignorant of anything that we can do for ourselves. As it would mean no money to them.

I will let you all know how it does. I have surgery on the 5th of January to remove all that they see.

After 11 years of surgery    followed by series of chemo trials she has finally hit the wall and decided to initiate a self healing approach to her cancer. Yeah. I was impressed by what I have reas on cellular zeolite and was wondering of those people taking it is it in the liquid form as suggested in the report as this penetrates the blood stream better than the powder.

I said mint or sallicitate and she never had a patient for that.    I am scheduled to be tested July 29	 2008 for everything.She indicated the tomato sauce I ate might have doen it as I had prego one night and home made the next.

You all don't know how much comfort I've gotten from these posts!My son (at the time 5 years of age) would periodically get itchy. It would start with his hands and feet or his face. Pretty soon the kid is covered in hives--it's so sad and he's completely miserable. Knowing what I know about allergies	 I was sure it was something dietary. We would have to give him Benadryl and the itching would subside. This has happened maybe three times before we made connections. Each time it happened	 we noticed he'd had a Halls cough drop. Bingo! No more of those	 no more itching. Then one day he had a piece of gum. I began reading ingredients and the only connection I could make was either the ""flavoring"" or the mint/menthol connection. I thought it was the flavoring because his favorite icecream is mint chocolate chip and he eats it with impunity.Today	 I gave him a heavenly piece of my mint filled dark chocolate and guess what?? He got red and itchy--hives all over his face	 cheeks etc. Back to the Benadryl and a complete and total ban of all things mint going into my baby's body.The positive in all of this is that he recognizes that it's bad for him and makes him miserable	 so he's willing to stay away from those things.

post_3546643	post_2246229	"hey everyone. sorry to hear about your allergies but i have found myself in a similar situation.i am allergic to spearmint but not menthol or peppermint however i do sometimes make mistakes. my allergy to spearmint is getting progressively worse. it use to make my lips swell	 make me cough and give me terrible stomach aches. that changed last Thursday when i thought i was brushing my teeth with peppermint toothpaste but it said ""freshmint"" which apparently means spearmint. my face and tongue swelled	 i could not breath	 struggled to stay conscious and could not feel my hands or legs (apparently that is to do with the lack of oxygen entering the body). i ended up in hospital. i can say my allergy is getting worse but i thought it was only me allegic to mint. Scary stuff.i looked up the difference between spearmint and pepper mint to see why i only react to spearmint and they are both very similar plants but not exactly the same so not sure why im only allergic to one. hope this does not mean i will eventually be allergic to all types.i am allergic to lots of other things	 not to the extent of my mint allergy but i do have allergic reactions almost every day. also suffer from eczema and hay fever.allergies are annoying and lots of people don't understand so i just want to say thank you for sharing and allowing me to share with you all my experience."	0
post_3626614	post_2246229	"I spent    half an hour with the pharmasist today who went through toothplastes and other things trying to find out what had mint and what didn't.    There were several that didn't have mint as an ingredient but the pharmasist had used them and remembered the flavour of mint.    Finally we looked at each other and said	 why not call the mfg's and ask them.    Well I called colgate and they only have one toothpaste that does not contain mint and that it the Childrens    Watermelon flavour.    I have several things that I still need to look into.    But the pharmasist also suggested something else I was looking for could be purchsed with a perscription.    If your not sure make sure you ask and keep looking and asking until you get an answer.I have had several doctors tell me that you can't be allergic to mint.    But I did find out recently that if you are having your allergies tested mint is one	 but it is on the end of a very long list.    It has to be specifically asked for.I have had headaches and upset stomaches just from the smell of mint (and many other things like strong coffee	 bacon and dark chocolate) since I was very little. Stomache aches	 head aches and diarrhea.I grew into an allergy of milk and eggs	    and apparently I may have grown out of it	 but if I'm not feeling good to start with	 it is wise just to stay away from them.About six years ago I was making Christmas cookies and decided to taste a candy cane pepermint cookie.    Well with in 30 seconds my face	 neck and hands were swollen	 my eyes and nose were nearly swollen shut and wouldn't stop running it was like full blown head cold in less than one minute.    It took 2 weeks to get it under control.The next Christmas I tasted just a crumb and started to swell immediately	 but I had the benelyn in my hand when I tried it and it took time but was under control alot faster.Eleven days ago I had something that had mint in it by accident and a couple of hours later I was swollen more than usual.    I have several conditions that cause swelling and didn;t think much of it.    The next morning I was so swollen I couldn't walk and my hands were useless.    That was when I thought of the candy that had mint in it.    The doctor put me on large dose of reactin and it has helped somewhat	 but what I didn't realise was that the lozengers I were using for my throat contained mint	 When I brushed my teeth that afternoon my whole face swelled and my eyes started running.    The next day I tried just using my mouthwash	 the same thing happened.    During this time my swelling was worse to the point where my skin was so tight on my legs that I couldn't bend them to go down the stairs.    My feet were so swollen that they had stretch marks.    It's gradually getting better	It is unbelieveable just how may things have mint in them and how many things are related to the mint that could be harmful.I would appreciate any information on products to use or even not to use as I am getting use to this allergy.Thanks"	0
post_3656203	post_2246229	"I	 too	 have an allergy to mint.    It started about 7-8 yeards ago after college.    I am a teacher and at the time was suffering terrible migraines.    At a work function that year	 I figured it out	 as the people on both sides of me were chomping on mint gum.For years I've had to make excuses to get away from people who are chewing mint gum while talking to me	 or eating a mint falvored ice cream cone.    I hate it.    And you are all correct; they give you a look when you tell them you allergic to what is in their mouth.    They think you're making it up or you can't wait to get away from them.Let me tell you	 teaching kids who try to sneak in mint gum to your class is no walk in the park.    I can literally smell mint gum across the room and it has made me physically ill many times.    The kids thought it was a ""neat trick"" and tried to see if they could fool me.    It took getting violently ill to get the point across.I am so sensitive that I can actually taste the mint that is in someone else's mouth...and for long periods of time.    I recently had to make an emergeny trip to the doctor because I was at a party where the caterer accidently put mint in the salad.My biggest problem is dealing with people who find the strongest mints/gum and then pass it out to all of their friends.    I'm to the point where I don't even care if I offend them by asking them to spit it out.    What do I have to do?    Carry a load of non-mint gum in my pocket as a trade for them having to get rid of a perfectly good piece of gum?I am glad I found this.    I can't tell you how lonely it has been.    Good luck to all.    :)"	0

post_3764162	post_2246229	"I saw a brand of toothpaste in the supplement store called Waleda.    This company comes from Germany.    They are even affordable.    I don't have a true allergy to mint	 but I am a little bit sensitive to it myself.    Some days I can tolerate a little bit of mint.    Just having commercial toothpaste in my mouth will make me sick to my stomach.    I simply cannot tolerate commercial toothpaste	 which led me to looking at what is available at the supplement store.    It seems that they have a few more options available than they used to.    And	 what's nice about many of the natural brands is that they are getting the message that people are looking for products that don't contain Sodium Lauryl (Laureth) Sulfate (SLS) and flouride.    That said	 I noticed that the Waleda brand has a formula that is labeled Calendula.    This is a flower that essential oils are extracted from that is known for being soothing to the skin.    I looked at the list of ingredients on this formula	 and I didn't see any mention of mint of any kind.    What I saw in the list of ingredients is fennel.    If fennel is okay for you	 then this formula might work for you.Tom's of Maine has a fennel toothpaste	 too	 but most of their formulas still have SLS in them.    SLS is a known carcinogen	 and it is irritating to the skin	 so if you have sensitive skin	 you'll want to avoid this ingredient."	1
post_3769140	post_2246229	"OMG!    Yes	 I have Oral Allergy Syndrome	 too!    It's awful!    I can no longer use my favorite herbs to season my foods.    And	 it's impossible to be a vegetarian with so many sensitivities to all those vegetables.    So many of the vegetables and herbs you mentioned are all in the same family.    I found out that I may also be allergic to something called mugwort	 due to the latex allergy.    More than likely	 you're also allergic to ragweed	 since so many people are.    I never did think that chamomile had much flavor	 but I discovered that it's just not worth drinking for me	 because it will give me a migraine.    Echinacea	 too	 since it's a close cousin.And	 like you said	 so many herbs that aren't called mint are still related to mint.    I love basil	 but it doesn't love me back.    Not worth it.     When the co-workers are always bringing mint cakes for company parties	    that really is cruel.    I know those co-workers don't understand	 but that doesn't mean that they should just bring something other people are allergic to just being in the vicinity of to the workplace.    That's not just showing a lack of understanding.    That's also just plain cruel.    Some people can die just by breathing in or coming into contact with just the smallest amounts of what ever the substance they're allergic to.    Maybe we don't go into anaphylaxis	 but that doesn't mean we don't get sick or suffer.    I can sure understand what you mean with the co-workers only bringing mint cakes.    Not only can't you partake	 but you have to leave the room	 because the mint fills the air and makes you feel sick.    Maybe they think it's a joke	 or they don't take it seriously if you're not getting anaphylaxis	 but that's not funny at all.I face a similar issue every time I leave my apartment or have to ride public transportation with many substances	 because I have Multiple Chemical Sensitvity (MCS).    It's hard for me going to my congregation where I am surrounded by people who I would consider to be my friends	 because so many of them KNOW I have allergies to perfumes and fragrances	 but wear the stuff to our congregation anyway.    I sit in a separate room with a glass partition	 so I can breathe and not get sick.    I also wear a filtration mask.    It's a similar issue to what leo421 faces when the co-workers insist on bringing mint cakes	 because it involves substances I have to breathe in.    I don't just get asthma attacks from the stuff people wear	 I get MANY other symptoms	 like nausea	 and will end up feeling sick for hours or even days after exposure."	0
post_3883224	post_2246229	"I've been allergic to mint and mint relations ever since I was 5 and now I'm 22. You'd be suprised at how many things are related; laverder and sage are the worst for me after ANY type of mint	 but the list also includes parsley rosemary tyme	 and a few others. Because of the fact that mint is an oil the reactions tend to linger for a day or two for me. Even if there is only one person in an average sized room chewing a type of mint gum my throat closes up	 I get nausea	 headaces	 I've even been known to pass out. Luckily I've learned the early symptoms and can generally get out of the situation before it gets really bad.Currently I'm using kid's toothpaste. I carry gum around so that I can give it to my friends and classmates that are chewing mint gum and they cannot have any perfumes or lotions that have mint in them. I've had to train my boyfriend to switch toothpastes as well as gum and a few other things because my reactions are so bad. The only cough stuff that I have found is Triamenic and Ludens also a good alternitive are jolly ranchers or lollipops	 just something that coat your throat. Just be careful with trying new stuff and make sure to read the ingredients	 even tissues and tylanol have mint in the now."	0

If someone in the room is chewing spearmint gum (Extra is the worst) my jaw tightens up and my eyes and mouth start watering and then I start getting very dizzy	 can't think and then I start having trouble breathing.

post_4101770	post_2246229	"I always knew I dislike mint	 especially spearmint	 but I never thought much about it.    About 20 years ago I accidentally swallowed a chocolate bonbon with mint cream filling in a party	 and it made me throw up.    That was when my friend suggested that I didn't just seriously dislike mint	 but I may be allergic to it.    I didn't take it very seriously because	 after all	 I could use mint toothpaste (as long as it isn't spearmint)	 like Colgate	 and I could use cough drops that are kind of minty.    I spoke of my ""allergy"" to mint more as a joke (because no one has ever heard of it) than truth	 until recently.Yesterday morning I walked into our office break room to make a cup of tea	 and noticed an open box of mint chocolate Girl Scout cookies.    The smell was offensive as usual but not too strong so I thought I'd just tough it out.    I finished cleaning my cup and got water from the hot water heater	 put a tea bag in	 and was out of there in no more than 2 minutes max.    Unfortunately	 it was long enough that that my throat and lungs began to feel restricted and I had trouble breathing. I gradually started feeling faint and lightheaded and had to go home.    The worst symptom went away in the afternoon	 but I still feel light-headed and weak today.This is the 2nd time I experienced a ""real"" reaction from breathing in mint	 and I finally realize food allergy can come from not just what I eat but what I breath. Whatever it is food manufacturers put in mint-flavored treats to make the smell carries for miles can easily be the death of me.    My husband and I both love murder mysteries	 and I told him it'd be very easy to stage an accidental death for me - just lock me in a room or an elevator with a plate of mint cookies	 and you got ""Death by Girl Scout Cookies"" - LOL!I have an appointment to see my physician about available treatments for emergencies; I don't like drugs but I want to be prepared if ever something like this happens again."	0

But just the smell of any kind of mint makes me feel ill and if I consume it I will BE ill. It's horrible	 disguisting stuff. When I was a kid I used to say I'd brushed my teeth when I hadn't because of it	 but in the end just started brushing my teeth without toothpaste (it is a miracle that	 at 24	 I'm the only person in my family without any dental work!).A couple of years ago I found a Colgate toothpaste that doesn't have any particular smell or taste and have kept that well in stock ever since. As for mouthwash	 I'm at a loss.

My symptoms are nowhere near as severe as some that have been posted	 but my sensetivity to mint is having a knock on effect on my health in other areas-namely my teeth. My tongue and mouth burn so badly when I use mint of any kind; plain	spear	arrow or peppermint (I'm not too sure about menthol) that I cannot face brushing my teeth anymore. First it burns badly then my mouth fills up with the same saliva you get just before you're sick - that type of saliva I have since found out is there to PROTECT your teeth from stomach acid during vomiting.I live on a small island called Shetland in the UK and don't have very much choice in toothpastes (or anything else to be honest) and am worried about my teeth. I brush them with water only and I know that can't be getting them totally clean. Please could someone suggest an alternative toothpaste	 one I could purchace online?Thanks."	0
post_4688037	post_2246229	"Tom's of Maine has some children's toothpaste that is not mint.    If fennel isn't a cross reaction for you	 they have an adult toothpaste with fennel in it.    Waleda is a German company that sells its products in the U.S. and Canada.    I can't use the one that I mentioned in a previous post myself	 because it turns out that I'm far more allergic to calendula (related to marigolds) than I am to mint.    A friend of mine still just uses baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to brush her teeth.    She also uses food grade hydrogen peroxide as her mouthwash.    Since mint isn't an issue for her	 she said that she will use mint oil on her toothbrush	 but I know that one doesn't have to use any essential oils at all.    I've used just the baking soda myself and have discovered that this is a good option for dental hygeine when mint is such an issue.    The baking soda really will freshen breath and clean one's teeth.    It's the best alternative I've found for myself	 since I have allergies to additional ingredients other than the mint.

I am 44 and just recently began telling people that I am allergic to mint because that seems to help them believe this is real for me.    My condition started as a child; I remember brushing my teeth was a real torture for me and my parents just thought I was being difficult.    As a youth my siblings enjoyed pinning me down and breathing mint on me - one time my parents were in the room and they just watched and everyone laughed.    The smell	 taste	 and touch of mint on my skin makes me gag	 my eyes water	 and skin burn. I am so glad to know that I am not alone and that this is not something in my head as most people believe it to be.    I had to educate my Dentist and her staff that all mint had to be removed from the room - they even use mint infused gloves there.    I plan to copy all of your wonderful comments and present them to my family	 friends	 and dental office.    The best comment on here was the ""death by girl scout cookies"" I laughed so hard since it could be true for me. Time to advocate for a mint-free society!!    The only mint related product that I use and that I can barely tolerate is my toothpaste - ultrabrite.........I've been too scared of gagging more to try anything else	 but I plan to try some of the suggestions offered here.

Really sick. Well a few days ago I was not thinking I had one chocolate covered Lindt candy. I spent the next 6 hours in the bathroom trying to get it out of my system. I finally started drinking warm vinegar water. And managed to get past the point of vomiting or the feeling of it.I do not understand how you year you can eat something and everything is fine and then bang your allergic. This has happened to several other food groups to me as well. I grew up drinking milk and now I am completely lactose intolerant as well. And shellfish. I love crab meat but now it too is in the allergic category for me.To me it feels more like food poisoning. An I guess that what it is becoming. It has become almost imposable to go out to a restaurant and eat with out becoming sick. One place restaurant told me they did not use any milk or have and seafood. Well I got a simple meal	 I made it out of the place after eating about 4 steps and returned the meal in the bushes in front of the place. I did not want to do that	 but my body said nope this is not the food for you. There was no way I could have made it to the restroom. I was sick for days. Come to find out one of the employees had cooked some crab patties for someones birthday. the pan was not washed out before cooking my meal. The manager of the place did refund my money and told me I could eat free next time. But my shadow will not darken their door way ever again . Oh well food allergies .............."	0

So then I thought to myself ok	 it must be from the cough drops. So I stopped eating them but the night after that I ate a candy cane. So am I allergic to mint? About 4 hours later and THE HIVES ARE BACK. I was looking around the internet and I could not find anything about mint allergies until I saw this site. I can see that hives are a symptom with some people so it can be a possibility. But I'm scared	 are my reactions going to get worse?"	0
post_5281494	post_2246229	"This is just crazy! I have been telling people for awhile now that I think that I have an allergy to mint because the smell and taste is just unbearable! The odd thing is is that Spearmint is the ONLY mint I can handle	 all other mints make me sick to my stomach and make my body cramp up	 I feel tired and weak and my jaw tightens. That I have noticed though	 my lips don't swell up and I don't think that my throat does either BUT for the past couple of years now	 I have broken out in hives like crazy and always wondered what it was! My toothpaste makes me sick to my stomach but I have just dealt with it and find myself in this bad habit of spitting for hours after I brush my teeth so as to get it out of my mouth. When I do tell people that I can't handle the smell of their gum or candy they too give me that ""look"" like that I am this big hypochondriac but in fact	 the symptoms of this mint allergy are the ONLY thing that I ever complain about! Also	 I have been having MAJOR leg pain for the past couple of years and am wondering if it is directed towards this allergy or whatever you would like to call it	 someone mentioned above that they have had leg cramping so it is strange. It's awesome to have found this website though and to know that I'm not alone!"	0

I cannot ingest anything with spearmint.    If I do	 my lips immediately swell up and my throat itches and then closes shut.People always make fun when I say that I am allergic to spearmint (especially when they offer gum	 and I have to ask what kind).    It's such an odd allergy - even an allergist I went to a few years ago said they could not test for it.Today	 after I showered I put on my deodorant (Old Spice Red Zone stick) which I have been buying for several years	 and my armpits immediately turned red all around and they itched severely.    I am not sure what's in it	 but I may have developed a new allergy...very odd.it's good to know that there are other ppl out there with this kind of allergy and that I am not crazy :)--Thiago"	0

Up until now	 I thought I was the only person in the world lol.I have a very very mild case of mint allergy compared with everyone here.Mint simply makes me light headed	 the stronger the smell of mint the more my head spins.The head spinning has always put me off consuming mint and I noticed it doesn't matter what type of mint or what form it is in	 it makes me dizzy.    And sometimes my stomach feels empty.I can't use mouthwashes	 cough drops (I remember this ONE with a beautiful flavor which had NO mint in it that I used when I was younger and unfortunately I haven't been able to find it since).    Toothpaste is horrible and I've tried the Colgate's watermelon flavored toothpaste for kids - so terrible I actually switched back to the mint kind lol.The best toothpastes for me (since I just can't find non-mint flavored ones) are the ones that are plain white with no blue or green or red colored strips.. those are impossible to use.    Funnily enough I can have and still love the orange flavored tic tac's and I even made a cordial from oranges and real mint.. with no reaction at all.However mint gum chewers are the WORST!! I hate them lol.    Yeah	 my friends think its funny to share around their mint gum and blow in my face.... that is great fun.I think my problem may be more with the smell.    I'm super sensitive to vapors.... but I do get light headed	 etc when I consume anything that has that minty taste!Oh worst shopping mistake.... mistaking normal peas for the mint flavored ones -_-"	0

post_6086953	post_2246229	"My first problems with mint happened around 4.5 years ago when I was pregnant.    Before then I cannot recall ever having issues with mint other than too strong of a scent would give me a headache.    During my pregnancy I found that the scent of mint would make me nauseous and eventually my head would not only hurt a little but throb.    At the time I was using mint toothpaste and I could not pinpoint why my throat constantly felt like sandpaper.    Finally I started realizing every time I would have a mint or piece of gum that the symptoms would worsen.    Now being anywhere near a mint plant makes my throat tighten and everything I buy for toothpaste to gum is all cinnamon now.    My sister has similar symptoms with mint.    When you tell someone you are allergic to mint	 their first reaction is like wow	 that is weird.    But I am glad to know there are others.    Dont feel so freakish now"	0

post_6470806	post_2246229	"I developed a mint allergy a few years ago... I thought it was just my toothpaste at first because I would get sores in my mouth and the sides of my mouth would split.    Then I started getting nauseous when I would chew mint gum or eat mint candy.    Then I started breaking out from chapsticks	 face washes	 shampoo	 body wash	 etc.    I get hives and my throat swells if i consume any mint.    Most people don't believe me when I tell them I'm allergic to it until I accidentally come in contact with it.    Just the smell of mint/menthol makes me sick and itchy.    I have found numerous toothpastes without mint with lemon	 grape	 watermelon	 bubble gum	 orange	 cinnamon	 and apple flavors.    My favorite is GO SMILE because it is whitening as well and lemon or apple flavored.    As for chapsticks I use Nivea a Kiss of Smoothness.    It is the ONLY one I have found that doesn't break me out.    Be careful about body/face washes	 lubricants	 condoms	 shampoos	 and even makeup because I've found out the hard way that alot of them contain menthol.    Covergirl cosmetics all have menthol.. anything that is ""tingling	 warming	 etc"" contains it as well.    The only cough drops or throat lozenges I have found are Halls Breezers and Ludens Throat Lozenges.    Orbit gums all have mint as well.    Their flavors are BubbleMINT	 CinnaMINT	 etc..

I thought I was alone too....what an amazing discovery!Definitely allergic to mint and adverse to LAVENDER too	 but just discovered on wikipedia that there is a common chemical called Linalool that probably is my biggest problem.    I also have a smaller similar reaction to basil	 oregano	 and sage	 which are also in the same family of 4-sided stem plants.Limonene and Salicylate are also found in mint	 but I don't think they are as much of an issue for me.    The other products that include them don't seem to cause me problems.When I smell Lavender	 it smells to me like the worst chemical in the world	 like turpentine	 not pleasant and soothing at all	 like it's supposed to be.    And I can't stand the smell of Bergamot Tea.    Does this happen to other people too?Regarding toothpaste	 after years of going into the bathroom and sneezing	 and getting rid of anything with perfume	 and noticing my gums felt swollen after brushing my teeth or drinking mint tea	 I learned about 20 years ago that people can be allergic to mint	 but never knew of anyone else until now.So	 I've experimented with different brands already mentioned above	 but the best one for me that I didn't see above is Nature's Gate Wintergreen Gel toothpaste.    I don't know if people realize this	 but WINTERGREEN IS A DIFFERENT PLANT AND SPECIES FROM MINT	 even though it is used in similar products.    But	 you have to be careful	 if it says ""wintergreen mint	"" it might have both ingredients.The other product people might want to be aware of is:Chloraseptic Allergen Block Gel made by Medtech Productswww.AllergenBlock.comIt's expensive to purchase	 but I only use a tiny amount under my nose now and then	 if I'm going to be exposed to mint at a large social gathering	 like a concert	 movie theatre	 or other activity where you're close to someone	 like dancing	 where a lot of people chew mint gum or suck on mint lozenges.    That's my biggest problem!When I'm exposed to mint/menthol odors	 my eyes tear	 my throat tightens	 sometimes I wheeze	 my eyes itch	 my nose runs an itches	 I sneeze	 get a headache	 nausea	 and generally feel anxious and uncomfortable.    I also have eczema	 mostly on my palms	 but think it's from other foods and soap allergies.Last year	 my dentist bought these new green non-latex gloves and I kept smelling mint and had a reaction.    Come to find out	 the manufacturer had the image of a mint leaf on the box	 but no mention of the word mint on the packaging	 so they called to complain and found out they were mint-scented gloves.    Crazy!I've tried alternative allergy treatments	 like NAET and a special liquid concoction made from mint	 but neither has worked.I agree that mint is over-used in products and I don't get it.    Now that I see mint allergies are more prevalent than I thought	 why aren't manufacturers being more careful?Lisa	 RNUSA"	0

Recently before my ACT test I had a bite of a cookie that had mint in it (I didn't know it did) and I had to leave in the middle of the test.I dont really use chopsticks so I can't help you there	 but for gum I always eat the Trident citrus	 and for toothpaste I use Oral-B Stages (it's a kids toothpaste but it doesnt have mint and it actually tastes good)It's good to know people have the same reactions that I do :)"	0

post_8288349	post_2246229	you are is a serious situation. I understand because I am allergic to fish and seafood just like that. I could walk into the house where my mom was frying fish and break out in hives and just have to get out of there and my family also thought I was making a big deal out of nothing. That is until I was allergy tested and the doctor told them how serious this was. I also ended up in the emergency room because of fish sauce in some pork egg rolls. Now that I am older I am becoming allergic to other things too. I am on line everyday trying to find out what may be causing my latest rashes. Good luck with your search and your parents.	0

Just to give these idiots a wake up call & to show what 'could' happen	 if they keep on being so childish. If that doesn't work	 find yourself some new friends.I had a scare a few weeks ago when I broke a tooth. My own dentist made it worse by breaking the remaining part of the tooth off	 below the gum line.I was referred to the dental hospital to get it sorted out. The dental hospital had a nine month waiting list	 so they referred me to one of their specialist dental practices to sort it out. I was seen a few days later by one of the professors from the DH	 who numbed the jaw & got to work. The assistant was using the suction pipe they use to remove debris from the mouth. It also blows out small amounts of moisture to help keep the mouth moist & to help to remove the bits. As soon as they put it in the mouth I could smell the mint they put in this water. I stopped the dentist & explained my allergy to the mint. He went to the on-screen notes	 where there was no mention of my allergy. So all the equipment was cleaned & the op restarted about 1/2 hr later. All went well thankfully!I went back for a check-up 3 weeks later & the Prof told me they had now stopped using the mint routinely during the ops & that I was now a permanent part of his lectures	 specifically about checking.Back at my own dental practice I went in to find the dentist who had originally treated me had been sacked	 after the prof had complained to them about the lack of info in my notes! The prof and my own practice are now working on getting him removed from the British Dental Association. Meaning he will no longer be able to practice as a dentist anywhere in the UK & Ireland.At first I thought this was a bit harsh	 but on thinking about it	 it isn't	 as he could easily have killed me"	0

Her daughter is also allergic to mint	 only slightly more severe.    She is a small child and mint makes her so sick that her body acts like it is going to shut down... mostly because it is.

That would be a good thing to know because the human immune system is extremely complex and if someone in a situation like that cuts what is throwing off their entire immune system (THE root cause) their food allergies can disappear.

I decided on the question	 I just don't know...    Some time around age 2 was when my grandma and my parents noticed my autism (I think this	 but I need to check with my parents to be sure) which was around the MMR shot... Did the shot trigger my autism?    I don't know...I figure it's pointless to hold up an imaginary crystal ball and wonder what if...just rather I am who I am	 no matter what circumstances helped shape me to be who I am right now.I figure to those who are concerned	 let them take steps to get rid of ""offending"" substances in shots and work towards a safer vaccination.    On the other hand if there truely is no link	 then it won't make much a difference.Here's something interesting. I think it covers both sides of the vaccine arguement/story.http://specialchildren.about.com/od/autismandvaccines/i/vaccines.htmSorry I can't give you a clear answer on that one... I figure if your child develops autism	 then embrace it as part of who they are and work on ways that can make their autism a strength rather than a weakness. There are some unique gifts with autism as well as the weaknesses.    Some of the same weaknesses can be made into strenghts. For instance being obsessed over bugs... Yes that got in the way of a lot of things	 but at the same time helped fuel the ideas that eventually developed into what project I am working on today.But if your child doesn't develop autism	 please don't take the attitude	 ""Phew I made it fine. My child is safe from this dreadful disease.""    And certainly please don't take the attiude that all autism is dreadful.    Not everyone affected by autism is suffering.    In fact some people like Temple Grandin have used their gifts to become very successful in their field. I'd like to see more done to help all autistic people be able to achieve their goals like Temple and others rather than try to stomp it out and ""cure"" it."	0

In some people	 absolutely.What makes 5HTP different than Prozac	 Zoloft	 Celexa	 Lexapro or one of the millions of other anti depressants on the market? FDA Approval.5HTP was originally marketed as L-Tryptophan. It worked for many people. It was a perscription drug. In 1990 the FDA banned all Tryptophan containing products from the market after an outbreak of a blood disease EMS. Tryptophan contained impurities that made it unsafe for consumption.It has been remarketed and sold as 5-HTP as a supplement in order to get around the FDA ban. It still will work for the same people that L-Tryptophan worked for. It is sold as an herbal supplement or ""natural alternative"" only because it cannot gain FDA approval. It is no more natural than any other antidepressant. It still contains the impurities. It still could make some people sick.It might work for you. You could always try it.I wouldn't fool myself into thinking it's ""safer"" or ""more natural"" though.It's a perscription medication that worked for many people and was rejected for making people sick. If it doesn't work	 don't feel bad about seeing a Dr that can prescribe something FDA approved. There are some wonderful medications out there."	1
post_4896246	post_4890212	"Thanks	 guys.You're right. 5-HTP does not have any approval of the FDA. However it is not a cheap medicine	 at least in my country.I've been prescribred Amitriptyline for my symptoms by my regular doctor	 and it seems to be working well. However	 the side effects of Amitriptyline are too scary. One of them is that it can make the symptoms worse.That's the reason I was looking for alternatives.I can understand your skepticism about the doctor who specializes in alternative medicine	 but if you have health care that ***** like the one in my country	 he is the one that most likely can diagnose your illness	 instead of constantly prescribring Paracetamol for all your symptoms.

post_6380244	post_4890212	"Hey all	I would like to offer an alternative opinion about the alternative medicines	 L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan).whodunnit said: ""of course it doesn't work anywhere near as effectively as prescription drugs. It's people flogging substabces because they are not qualified to sell the real meds	 anti d's. Can you not see that? ""This is quite untrue in the case of (hopefully the majority	 I don't know the stats on bad vs good suppliers) vendors who provide pure 5-HTP or L-Tryptophan with a genuine interest in their customers well being	 and providing a product which is as stated.When you understand what Tryptophan actually is	 the idea of it being a fake med - which presumably must be the inverse of a ""real med""	 is really not the case.L-Tryptophan is one of the essential amino acids - this is something we cannot produce in the human body	 but require in order to live balanced healthy lives. Serotonin and Melatonin	 two vital compounds in human brain function	 are produced in the body as a result of the metabolism processing L-Tryptophan.5-HTP is not Tryptophan re-branded. 5-HTP is the result of metabolism of L-Tryptophan.When it was banned by the FDA	 this was the same week that promotion of Prozac began in full swing.http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal53.shtmlTo quote Alexander Shulgin:- Start of quotation -""Then	 an incident occurred in 1989	 at the Showa Denko company in Japan	 where a change in the manufacturing procedure produced an impure product. The impurity led directly to a health problem	 a condition with a flu-like syndrome called Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) which cause some 1500 incidents in the United States	 including 38 deaths. The FDA quite rightly removed tryptophan from the market on the 17th of November	 1989 and banned its distribution. The source of the health problem was quite quickly identified	 and the production operation was changed back to the original process	 and the tryptophan product was again available free of any toxic impurity. This freedom from any impurity was acknowledged by the FDA	 but they transferred the toxic aspect of the substance from the impurity contained within it (now no longer present) to the substance itself. The implied declaration was that tryptophan was intrinsically toxic.The sale of tryptophan as dietary supplements for man is now illegal. Dietary supplements to animal stock feed is OK. Tryptophan is available to hospitals for use in critical situations. Tryptophan is available as a prescription drug. But it is not available in the health food stores and so cannot be explored by the lay researcher. The world of inquiring into the action on normals	 schizophrenics	 alcoholics	 people who are overweight	 people who are depressed	 is denied both to the private individual and to the clinical researcher. There are commercially available drugs	 all approved	 that can play the same role. Within four days of the announced ban of tryptophan (after the problem had been resolved and corrected) a broad promotion of Prozac (an antidepressant similar in action to Tryptophan) appeared in Newsweek (March 26	 1990). Prozac is still widely promoted. Tryptophan is still not available to the private individual. Both can play the role of being an effective sedative.A quotation from the FDA Dietary Supplement Task Force Report	 page 2	 June 15	 1993	 deserves careful reading.""The [FDA] Task Force considered various issues in its deliberations	 including ... what steps are necessary to ensure that the existence of dietary supplements on the market does not act as a disincentive for drug development.""What are dietary supplements? How might they get in the way of pharmaceutical industry creations? Where is the line to be drawn between nature and big business? What plants are there that might serve as health adjuncts? I truly think that we are being had by the powers that be	 who are authorized to control our access to medicines. Today we cannot eat ABC because it contains an outlawed drug. Tomorrow we cannot eat DEF because it is suspected of containing an outlawed drug. The day after tomorrow	 we cannot eat GHI because it has not been shown to be free of outlawed drugs. And yet	 everything in the drug store had its origins somewhere in a botanist's observation or in a chemist's mistake. Where does this oppression stop? When do we say	 hold	 enough?""- End of quotation -The situation is further outlined here:http://www.ceri.com/rev-sero.htm- Start of quotation -Just days after the FDA banned tryptophan	 the cover of Newsweek announced the arrival of Prozac	 a _  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor_   which became the blockbuster drug of the 90s. Unlike tryptophan	 which raised serotonin levels by making more serotonin	 Prozac raised serotonin levels by inhibiting the reuptake (recycling) of serotonin. Fortunately for Eli Lilly & Co	 tryptophan_  s unavailability had created a serotonin vacuum that Prozac could fill. And fill it it did. Prozac_  s popularity and profitability were wildly spectacular.Although Prozac was successful at raising serotonin levels and relieving many of the symptoms of serotonin deficiency	 it had a dark side. Reports of suicides	 bizarre personality changes and anti-sexual side effects began to emerge. So did reports of Prozac resistance	 whereby regular dosage increases were required to maintain effect.Some of these problems were caused by the unnatural way that Prozac modulated serotonin levels. By interfering with the reuptake	 reuse and/or recycling) of serotonin	 Prozac actually caused decreases in the cellular stores of serotonin that are needed to maintain increased serotonin levels at the target neurons. In simpler words	 Prozac 1)undermined its own action	 and thereby 2) created a greater clinical need for its use. This is exactly opposite to the way tryptophan increases serotonin by increasing serotonin stores.During the following years	 other serotonin reuptake inhibitors entered the market. Many did quite well economically. Whether these drugs would have done well faced with open competition from tryptophan will never be known. However	 it does seem an improbable and fortuitous coincidence that the FDA eliminated Prozac_  s only competition at exactly the right time to facilitate Prozac_  s market success.- End of quotationContinues on"	1
post_6380246	post_4890212	"Also please read this page	 which covers most of these topics in brief	 but clear terms:http://intelegen.com/nutrients/5htp_5hydroxytryptophan_vs.htmwhodunnit: ""Sorry but that is not a real doctor at all. He knows better but chooses to flog this stuff to people. Why? Because it's cheap.""The pharmaceutical industries should look more (in some cases increasingly with Cannabinoid and other psychedelic research this seems to be happening) to nature for inspiration	 with the potential for compounds from natural sources to heal in a natural and balanced way.Here's an example of a trial which involved the combination of Prozac (Fluoxetine) with Tryptophan with success: [SEE NOTE BELOW LINK FOR WARNING]http://www.biopsychiatry.com/tryptophan.htm[NOTE: It is strongly inadvisable to take 5-HTP or Tryptophan in conjunction with SSRIs without consulting your doctor. Most doctors would advise against it due to the potential for developing Serotonin Syndrome due to too much serotonin in the body. This can be a potentially fatal illness.The trials that need to be done to see how for example	 supplements of 5-HTP or Tryptophan used in conjunction with SSRIs such as Prozac might be beneficial	 are needed (I don't know of the number of trials or their conclusions). A clear reason against trials might be the fact that there are associated risks of this combination.This page covers the topic:http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=49kLK--eumEC&pg=PA690&lpg=PA690&dq=tryptophan+metabolised&source=bl&ots=gjn6txAtae&sig=6iREeRjBwUxK_jUVyM7gw0zu2Vg&hl=en&ei=tZfpTITXFcbMhAfv3qmMDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=falseA lot of the arguments around use of supplements seem to include the point that these are not fully tested or approved. Unfortunately ""approved"" compounds like Fluoxetine (Prozac) have had wide reports of terrible side effects. Everything in moderation - well perhaps not everything	 but certainly in the case of these compounds	 different people will experience different effects. Ensure that anything you buy is pure	 and from a reputable supplier.With regard to the above topic	 and as mentioned on the above link	 there is evidence that 5-HTP might be more likely to cause Serotonin Syndrome when used with SSRIs than L-Tryptophan in combination with SSRIs. 5-HTP can also cause problems with high blood pressure patients	 for example.L-Tryptophan has to compete with other amino acids in order to cross the blood-brain barrier. Taking L-Tyrosine with L-Tryptophan can help it in this competition. Again all of these considerations should be brought to the attention of your doctor if you feel prescription anti-depressants are not working for you. They all have their benefits and risks	 but there is strong evidence that the FDA and pharmaceutical industries have not been working with people's health at the forefront	 while quick to outlaw some of the most essential compounds in our bodies!Robin Brinkler"	1

post_2559911	post_15004	"I've done considerable lay research on this topic	 so here's what I can offer.First	 you may have inherited naturally overactive apocrine sweat glands in your underarms. Apocrine secretions are odorless	 but when naturally-present microbes feed off these secretions	 they release a malodorous metabolic byproduct. What compounds the problem is your anxiety	 which creates a feedback loop resulting in increased perspiration	 higher localized skin temperature	 greater smell	 and on and on. The end result is the perfect storm for odor	 as microbes love warm	 humid areas	 and you have conditioned yourself to be hypersensitive to peoples' negative evaluations.First	 consider getting a prescription antiperspirant. These are about 4 to 5 times stronger than the off-the-shelf type.Second	 start doing guided imagery/meditation/yoga *twice* daily	 which will slowly retrain your sympathetic nervous system not to overreact to stressors. Doing this twice daily (20 minutes each) is important.Third	 you need in-vivo exposure therapy--basically	 a therapist or friend who can help you face stressful environments without you freaking out. You have to work your way up a pyramid of fear-inducing settings	 from minor to major. For a good read	 check out Jerilyn Ross' book	 ""Triumph Over Fear.""Fourth	 it's a good idea to avoid spicy	 pungent foods	 to exercise frequently	 and to practice good hygiene.My best guess as to why people sneeze and such around you	 is that when you're highly anxious	 your increased respiration essentially aerosolizes and intensifies the scents in your antiperspirant (even if ""unscented"")	 thus basically surrounding you with an invisible cloud of allergens. The technical people at the Monell Center in Philadelphia about 10 years ago released a study indicating that we all have an invisible cloud	 if you will	 surrounding us	 composed of microscopic skin particles	 dust	 fragrances	 etc. Yours probably is stronger	 and people react with the symptoms you describe. A respected	 U of Penn. dermatologist told me about 10 years ago that some people's body chemistry sometimes reacts with antiperspirants such that it creates a very dilute hydrochloric acid--itself an allergic.A last observation: When you mention your symptoms	 people will read their own symptoms into it. You did not mention fecal odors. Other posters did. I have no information on the latter. But the key to your issue is to learn how to relax your hypervigilant mind and hyperaroused body	 and perhaps find a cognitive-behavioral therapist who can work on your social discomfort."	1

post_5371252	post_15004	"i have read ur comments. one thing u people r not considering and i am suffering too is the smell with effects others is high level of harmons which released with breathing and irritate others and cause them to sneezing etc.I could not got any better suggestion but if any one has then let me know.First thing is that as anxiety starts	 the brain issues signal (chemicals) for the heart to beat faster. If anxiety lasts long	 the harmons level remain very high. This heart specific harmon is volatile. As its levels become high	 it is also spread in your room effecting other person's anxiety sensitive sensors located in nose.Other people think that it is smell of smoke but it is actually my high level of hormons which also cause high heart beat.This also initiates high level of enzymes released in stomach which cause bad smellpeople to help me can contact me at ***@****"	1

I plan on getting some therapy soon because I think I might just put an end to everything. I am so unhappy and depressed. I can barely have a social life. This problem has affected me in so many ways. I gave up everything I had. I was going to one of the best universities in the country	 but after my freshman year	 I basically had no friends	 I was severely depressed because of my anxiety	 and everything in my life went downhill.Doctors are not much help because when you go to them	 they tell you that nothing is wrong. I'm just exhausted now. All I ever wanted in my life was to go to college	 meet people	 and be a normal 20 something year old young woman. I graduated at the top of my class in high school and now I'm resigned to just going to school online and not meeting anyone."	0

It's effective for me for at least one week. I stopped putting it on because there was a painful effect when I applied it. But like I said	 it worked! My underarm became super dry that I didn't have to put on a deo.After a week	 the sweat returned	 'till now. I just let it happen.Try it. Hope it works for you guys."	0

They would hold their noses	 move away from me	 and cough and clear their throats once I came in the room	 and they would make these disgusting faces	 crack jokes	etc. I was so scared about this body odor problem I would take deodorant to school and run in the bathroom to cake it on if I thought I was offending anyone	 but it didn't matter it would not go away. For 10 years this would be my life	 when I told my parents they thought I was crazy when I went to the doctor like a lot of you they said nothing was wrong. I was about to give it all up	 when I realized that this is something that I am going to have to conquer or deal with so I can make something out of my dam self body odor or not	 I knew it wasn't my fault and people fear and ridicule what they don't understand. While I still to this day have this body odor problem I know it comes from anxiety and just thinking that I smell bad. I plan to get counseling	 and I am on medication and Xanax which helps a little bit. I notice it feels good to talk about it either to myself or to people who understand which would be you guys. I thought I was the only one and I really felt alone	 but after hearing you guys stories I know that I am not and that feel good also. I am in college and failed a couple of semesters because of this problem	 but I am bouncing back and I am trying to remain positive	 but it still hurts that I know that society wont except me the way I am	 that that beautiful girl might run away from me when I approach her	 but you know what guys its going to get better I promise just stay strong and go out there no matter what and just try and live your life..... I am doing it and I am not going to stop until I get my degree and live the life just like everybody else we deserve it.

I dont know whether or not I smell anymore	 or if its those comments have been cause of other stuff (perhaps having a bad smell day...). I guess I dont get so many comments about it cause I live such an isolated/routine life (due to the body odor).

post_7061537	post_15004	"I have an anxiety disorder - mainly OCD and social anxiety for which I am on medication and in therapy. I really empathise with all of you	 because despite showering regularly	 using deodorant	 wearing clean clothes etc	 I find myself smelling when I get anxious	 which in turn makes me self-conscious and more anxious. The smell comes from my arm pits	 but I also notice that when I am very stressed	 I start to get abnormal vaginal discharge which smells horrible! Like several people above	 I also worry people think it is due to a lack of personal care.However	 sweating is a normal response to a frightening or stressful situation	 so I think if you experience high levels of anxiety it is normal to sweat and therefore smell more quickly than other people. Excessive stress can also lead to bacterial vaginosis and there are gels you can buy which can help and are effective for the latter...you can get them from your local pharmacy.It's easier said than done	 but don't give yourself a hard time...it's not your fault. Try to address the anxiety with therapy if appropriate	 relaxation and breathing exercises	 meditation	 yoga etc. Recognise triggers for anxiety and work on those. When you are beginning to get anxious take a breather. There are some great suggestions in the posts above. I think I might give a really high strength anti-persp deodrant a try	 until I get my anxiety problems sorted!"	0

The Men's Deodorant's do NOT stop sweating and actually MIX with the sweaty bad body odors. With the ladies anti-antiperspirant I do not really sweat and if I do its not that bad. I use it on my underarms and my chest area. I also put a dab of GOOD Cologne on everyday.I haven't had a issue in 15 years. I also use a Big Scuff Ball instead of wash clothes during bathing or showering. It scrubs the dead skin and odors away. Also I wash and scrub my feet too.

post_7827383	post_15004	"First of all	 let me say that i am a recovering ""body odor"" anxiety sufferer. I am currently 30 yrs old	 and have only been anxiety free from body odor for about 5 years. It started around 7th grade	 with a small comment from a family member stating that i smelled. It was a downward spiral from there	 which made high-school a living hell. I was convinced that i had body odor all day	 every day after small amounts of sweating. It would only take me overhearing someone mention the words like ""smell	 stink	 odor	 etc"" that would send me into a reclusive	 introverted state. I assumed everyone thought i smelled. This anxiety only caused me to sweat more. I am by nature an extremly outgoing	 and friendly person. However	 anyone (outside of immediate family) who knew me back in the day would have told you i was a loner	 loser	 and very strange.Currently	 i own a business with 45 employees	 which requires me to be very up close and personal with people on a daily basis.Let me say this.....I have no idea to what extent or severity of an odor that my body produces when i sweat. All i can say	 is that now that i have conquered the fear of smelling	 whatever smell i project doesnt seem to bother anyone as bad as i thought.I think our minds start to go into warp speed when it comes to this disorder. Thats right	 i said disorder.This is how i got over it.......I went on vacation to the beach for a week when i was 18. While there	 i met about 8 other individuals who were there on vacation as well hanging out on the beach. I decided at that point that since i was 400 miles from home	 and i would probably never see these people again	 i would just be myself and get to know them	 and just forget about body odor regardless of how offended they were by the way i smelled.We all hit it off	 and suddenly it occured to me that nobody was offended by my body odor. I started getting closer to people	 and by closer i mean the space between how far i stand from them. Where before	 a yard space between me and a person felt like inches	 i suddenlu didnt care anymore. I left that trip with the conclusion that most of this body odor thing was in my mind. Sure	 i may have had body odor	 that is totally possible. I still to this day dont know if it was all in my head	 or if my body put off a distinct odor when i got nervous. All i know is	 the way you handle this disorder is contageous.What i mean is...... If you continue to accept the fact that you smell	 and that this smell offends everyone	 you will continually get worse.However	 if you can find it inside of you somewhere	 just to let go	 and not care	 if even for a weekend	 i think that you will find that the results will be contageous in a positive way.Sorry for the novel	 but i just wanted to offer some encouragement. You can beat this. And the best way to do it is to just let go. Easier said than done	 i know. It took me most of my life to beat it. Now	 im well known in the community	 and love to socialize."	0
post_7929050	post_15004	"All of your ideas work. When I learned that sweat itself is odorless	( that the bacteria on skin causes the odor)    I realized I needed to change certain things.    I cut back on spices like cumin	 curry and garlic.I shave and/or wax all body hair.    I started using antibacterial liquid soap to shower.And most important	 BEFORE applying anti-perspirant/deodorant I spread a thin film of Neosporin or any triple antibiotic on both armpits	 small of the back	and private parts. Worked like a charm. I still get a lil nervous about people getting to close to me	 but I KNOW I don't reek or smell bad anymore. Hope this helps and works for you!"	1

post_8193679	post_15004	"Hey everyone	I'm 33 yrs old and I am also one who falls victim to this. I'm writing ehre in hopes that someone will read it and shed some light in my situation. Although I have not yet been clinically diagnosed I get anxious around people because of a fear that i smell. My best of friends try to reassure me that I don't but I'm lead to think one of two things. 1) they're hiding the truth from me	 2) they're used to my smell. How could I think this way with my friends?For about two years now when I'm around strangers I've been paying attention to the way people react after they look at me when standing close enough. I get more reactions to pay attention to when I speak. As some mention here	 there are the varieties of touching their nose. What gets me most is when people actually say stuff like ""smells like bathroom in here"" or ""what's that god awful smell?"" when i'm just 2-5 feet away. As people approach me in as I stand in crowded areas	 I'll notice people look right at me as if they can tell even in a sea of people that i'm the culprit of a nearby odor. Like many here I shower every morning before I leave the house and once more before I go to bed. The people I ask continue to tell me they don't smell anything. Yet the other reactions I watch out for continue.""It's all in the mind"" my friends insist. And after reading your comments I realized something that's been playing in my mind -- that there's a vicious circle with anxiety of B.O and B.O. itself. If anxiety triggers B.O. and bad odor is what you're concerned with in social situations	 you're bound to have it. The only way to avoid it is to not think about it	 right?I definitely try not to think about it sometimes and most of the time I'm successful. Friends reassurance + shower / brush teeth before I leave the house have me thinking there's nothing to worry about and anything I notice should be coincidence and warrant no explanations. I'm a man of many artistic talents so I really have a lot to be confident about. I'm even a lead singer of a band. We're great. People love us. Unfortunately still	 my walls get chipped at the sight of every nose twitch and my world turns upside-down the second someone says ""what's that smell?""I exercise regularly so i know it's not that. I don't drink alcohol often. My diet is quite good and consistent. I can only get stronger by continuing to not care what people think but sometimes I can't help it. But now i feel it's my only choice besides medication which I absolutely refuse.So that's my story. Thanks for reading."	0

post_2379563	post_2379005	"Here's the deal: trypto	 found in poultry	 cheese	 and as a purified drug in finer department stores everywhere	 acts to help your body produce more seratonin	 which is a kind of ""brain juice"" that may induce or support a calmer feeling about things.

post_3026197	post_3026105	"Hi	The skin on the surface of your fingers and toes is different from the skin covering the rest of your body. It_  s thicker due to constant contact	 abrasion	 and pressure. Your fingertips and toetips contain networks of dense	 tough connective tissue. This tough tissue anchors the outer skin to the underlying layers known as the _  dermis._  If you soak in water long enough	 protective oils get depleted from your skin. Water can leak in to your skin after awhile. In warm water like in a bathtub or pool	 the thick skin on your fingers and toes tends to absorb water and swell. But this swelling doesn_  t happen uniformly.Instead	 the regions of skin that are most heavily anchored from below will remain lower than the more softened and swollen regions. The result - those temporary wrinkles on your fingers and toes. Other parts of your skin don_  t have the same densely-reinforced design - so	 no matter how much you soak	 the rest of your skin tends to stay smooth.ref:http://www.earthsky.org/faq/after-a-long-bath-why-do-your-fingertips-look-wrinkledIn your case the skin of your palms maybe devoid of oils(do spend a lot of time in the water during the day)	 so the same re-actio"	0

post_3790471	post_3026105	"My hands had the wrinkling like crissybill as well	 then it turned to cracking	 bleeding	 scaling/peeling and painful. I have to constantly keep bandaids on. Once I get them almost healed and the new skin isn't peeling anymore	 it starts all over again. I do have eczema on the tops of my fingers and I use a topical cream for that but the cracking on my fingertips doesn't seem to be affected by the cream. I try to do minimal had washing and switched to a milder soap. This really got bad once I started breastfeeding back in May of this year. Any advise? Do you think the breastfeeding has anything do do with it? My ARNP says that when you breastfeed you are in a constant state of dehydration.

post_5110500	post_3026105	"Wrinkles on your fingertips	 can be caused from sweating fingers. Before I sprayed my Pc mouse with 9 coats of Clear Lacquer to cover the plastic	 my plastic allergy	 ""although mild allergy compare to the other synthetics"" this mild allergy to the plastic caused the mouse to make my finger tips and palm to sweat. And the sweating so much	 for me being on the PC so long all the time	 made my fingers get wrinkled at the tips. Same theory as being in the bath tub too long. Only instead of water it is sweat. Key here would be fingers are wet too long.I also got some tingling. However	 even though I usually itch when touching an allergen like plastic or polyester	 my fingers have a heavy skin for I am a man and have tough hands. But anyways	 my thumb sweat the most from this and the skin on it got a big spot that blistered and peeled	 over and over.So the only input I can give here is excessive hand sweating	 and/or prolonged sweating is causing this. Sweating at the point of an allergen contact is one symptom of this ACD condition.But to say that is what is making this happen to you people is to guess.So ask yourself	 Do my hands sweat while holding the mouse. And is the sweating from the plastic or just from holding the hand and fingers on a non absorbing surface	 which would maybe make them sweat. And then ask yourself	 ""Do my hands sweat that much or at all when I hold other things which are non absorbent? And ""do they sweat with absorbent things I hold	 leaving this surface of ""whatever I am hold"" damp or wet from sweat?""If the answer to that is no	 or only other synthetics like polyester	 vinyl	 plastics. then the answer becomes clearer.Ask yourself also ""Do my feet sweat a lot when I wear colored socks? Because this happens to people and not for the color. The body doesn't sweat from colors. It sweats because colored socks are polyester or have plenty in them. All cotton colored socks fade and get pilly. And white socks are mostly cotton or at least 80% cotton	 and absorb what little sweat 2-20% polyester makes one sweat.Or do your feet sweat or itch a lot from the shoes? These are reactions that come and go. But one thing is for sure folks. Plastic allergy is very real. Although mild for most compared to other synthetics	 or higher quality plastics.This condition I have is called Allergic contact dermatitis. Defined as a delayed reaction from contact with an allergen. However the sweating in not delayed	 or at least fairly quick compared to the rashes	 redness	 swelling	 and other syptoms(symptoms).I hope this shed some light for you. Consider it	 but do not stop your quest here.Masking tape over the mouse helps me too. That is what I did before spraying it to see. And it helped for the most part. However some does go through the tape. You have to cut the gaps between the bottons	 and around them with a razor so it funtions okay. Also note that the wheel being a synthetic may do the same thing to you if you use it. So don't during testing. And if this it it	 then you have a mild allergy to plastic.Thus you can clear coat with a non allergen which is very hard to block out allergen. But it bleeds into the clearcoat if it is not fast drying. So use Lacquer	 For those properties. And 9 thin coats will be enough!Hint: I have done this clear coat to my keyboard	 mouse	 telephone	 desk top surface	 and every other hard synthetic in my house that I have to touch. As well as vinyl				 well you get the point.Please report back! :)"	1

post_5223002	post_3026105	"Hi GuysI have this problem also and I urge you all to go and see your doctor as this can be a sign of a connective tissue disorder such as Raynauds syndrome	 scleroderma	 CREST	 lupus etc and I find it very interesting that so many of you are female and with young children/babies as mine also occured after having my daughter	 now two.    Connective tissue problems run in my family and are tricky to diagnose with many GP's not having a clue.    It has taken us nearly 6 years to get my mum diagnosed	 but the point is early treatment is really crucial.    Try also looking up a supplement called MSM which I am about to start taking.I would be interested to find out if any of you feel you are extra sensitive to cold or pain or have aching joints.    Do you suffer with cold hands and feet?    If so there is probably a link between that and fingertip wrinkles.

post_5689092	post_3026105	"It seems as if most of the people with wrinkled fingertips consist of low fat diets. Pregnant women will watch their diets because of the child. Meaning	 there is less ""fatty"" foods being digested. My hypothesis is based off Dr_Aparna. If short-term wrinkled fingertips are because of the water going into the pores of the skin and thus making swollen fingertips. Long-term wrinkled fingertips could be triggered because of possibly the following:the low fat diets mean there wont be as much sweat being released from the glands in the body. The pores wont be opened and the glands will be clogged. The water will stay there and any sodium will add to the wrinkles. As for those who work out	 there might be less sweat coming from the hands and more from the rest of the body depending on what the work out technique is. I remember reading about someone on an earlier post saying that they get this from sweaty hands because of plastic allergens. The irritation might release sweat to relieve the skin. A large amount of sweat means more wrinkled hands	 and the sweat also contains sodium which might dry up the hands even more. There are many flaws with my theories	 but I wanted to help out with this community. Do not judge me for I am only 14. If your hands are wrinkled when they are cold	 that might be some reverse of the body. Possibly an autoimmune disease which releases sweat when you are cold rather than warm. Maybe it can be a neurological disorder in which the body's hormones send the wrong signals throughout the neurons. The pores will be filled with fluids in the thickest part of the skin. My possible cure for it	 3 minute water exposures every 2 hours. Avoid heavy oils such as hand sanitizers because they clog up the pores even more. Then again	 what do i know?"	1

post_6276541	post_3026105	"I can tell you that I have had this for about 20 years! I think I got it from my wife when we first started dating. She showed it to me that she had it then a few weeks later I had it! I have been giving her hell ever since. I had the best hands too. Fortunately it's not on the top. I think it is some kind of a virus/bacteria that can be spread between people. It started with the little blisters and then the fingers went all wrinkly. I went to the doctor about 6 months ago	 having enough of it after 20 years	 and she subscribed Alcotrin A. I don't know if it's helping or not. I haven't got my wife to start using it so I don't let her hold my hand or touch my hands. Makes for a happy marriage. Not!

post_6439819	post_3026105	Has anyone figured this out yet?    I have had the same exact symptoms - sensitive wrinkled fingertips for about a week now.    I had this condition about a year ago and went to see my doctor who had no idea - it went away on it's own after a month or so.    Now it's back and it is very irritating!    I'm afraid to go back to the doctor because I'm assuming she will be clueless again.Interesting note although it doesn't appear that everyone on this post is female so I don't believe it is related - I am currently breastfeeding and had my 2nd c-section earlier this year.    I don't have any of the other issues mentioned.	0
post_6585019	post_3026105	"Please read and consider:My fingertips do the very same thing just under a minute in hot & cold water. However	 it has been happening quickly recently whereas when I was a child I had to sit in the bath till it was cold when my fingers would wrinkle. Many others also have other symptoms like joint & body pain and tiredness - generally    like a thyroid problem and on it goes.Consider that it is not a medical condition you just got but a long term exposure from something you all have in common. The water! the FDA recently just announced they might lower the does of FLUORIDE in the drinking water.1) Fluoride is a cumulative poison. On average	 only 50% of the fluoride we ingest each day is excreted through the kidneys. The remainder accumulates in our bones	 pineal gland	 and other tissues. If the kidney is damaged	 fluoride accumulation will increase	 and with it	 the likelihood of harm.2) Fluoride is very biologically active even at low concentrations. It interferes with hydrogen bonding (Emsley 1981) and inhibits numerous enzymes (Waldbott 1978).3) When complexed with aluminum	 fluoride interferes with G-proteins (Bigay 1985	 1987). Such interactions give aluminum-fluoride complexes the potential to interfere with many hormonal and some neurochemical signals (Strunecka & Patocka 1999	 Li 2003).4) Fluoride has been shown to be mutagenic	 cause chromosome damage and interfere with the enzymes involved with DNA repair in a variety of cell and tissue studies (Tsutsui 1984; Caspary 1987; Kishi 1993 and Mihashi 1996). Recent studies have also found a correlation between fluoride exposure and chromosome damage in humans (Sheth 1994; Wu 1995; Meng 1997 and Joseph 2000).5) Fluoride forms complexes with a large number of metal ions	 which include metals which are needed in the body (like calcium and magnesium) and metals (like lead and aluminum) which are toxic to the body. This can cause a variety of problems. For example	 fluoride interferes with enzymes where magnesium is an important co-factor	 and it can help facilitate the uptake of aluminum and lead into tissues where these metals wouldn't otherwise go (Mahaffey 1976; Allain 1996; Varner 1998).Drinking any liquid	 pop	 soda	 diet	 coffee	 they all use water	 even our sweetner's are damaging to the central nervous system.Do your research for yourself because no one has your best interest except for you and you can trust yourself and everybody knows their own body."	1

post_6652573	post_3026105	"37	 wrinkly fingertips	 slightly raw and sometimes accompanied by what feels like little postules in the skin.    Some minor peeling on the hands.    A few things I've noted about my own condition:1) seems to be seasonal2) is not daily but I haven't paid enough attention to note if there's a reactive trigger (my guess is that there is)3) I've always wrinkled fast in water	 even as a kid4) I have exceptionally sensitive hands no matter what (very tactile person and don't even like to wear gloves if I can help it - they feel too restrictive.    Same with my feet).5) my extremities do get cold easily - always have.6) this is a fairly new and relatively rapid occurrence7) lotion/hand creme does seem to help with the wrinkles	 which might indicate some sort of hydration problem in the epidermis; notice my hands are generally dry when this occurs (but not always visibly - is there a connection? don't know)Some other factors:I'm on the computer alot - so I type alot.    My guess is if you found this forum	 you probably are as well.    Connection?    Dunno.I have had 2 C's but I highly doubt that's a factor.    Mine are 8 & 11 and this is more recent than that.    Is it possible?    Sure.    Likely?    Doubtful.I am on birth control.. hormonal therefore giving the appearance of birth/pregnancy/nursing related?    Much more likely.I'm often stressed	 which also affects hormones.. have I noticed a link?    Haven't looked to be honest but considering many have said that their ""condition"" gets worse when under pressure	 very possible.Many have mentioned thyroid	 fibromyalgia and other diseases/disorder that can affect hormone fluctuations.My BEST logical guess:Many are already hypersensitive people to their environment and any disruption in the natural balance of their particular systems may trigger a hormonal spike or decline thereby also triggering this ""condition"" - including me.    Note that there is a difference between a cause	 correlation and trigger.    I am not a doctor nor any kind of medical professional... I'm just fairly decent at putting pieces together and draw a fairly reasonable conclusion that are often (but far from always) pretty close to accurate.I would propose that we pay attention to changes in our physical	 emotional and pyschological environments and when this whole fingertip problem arises and see if we can find any type of relationship.    Maybe therein we'll find our own answers regardless of any medical professional.Oh	 and for the person who posted about the fluoride issue	 although fluoride poisining is a valid concern for some	 not all states regulate their water the same way and therefore	 fluoride concentrations vary.    Unfortunately	 unless we're all from the same State and region of that state with the same water filtration system	 I'd have to personally suggest that your theory is pretty likely to be inaccurate.    But that's just me guessing based on limited knowledge of the water works industry."	0

post_6694633	post_3026105	"I like the idea of trial and error offered up before. Good science is good observation and trial and error is definitely a good means to observation. You may want to pay attention to associated signs and symptoms. For example: Increased thirst	 Use of topical creams	 diet (especially common food allergies)	 numbness and tingling/altered sensation	 your local fluoride content	 dizziness	 season	 activities	 soaps/detergents. Im not sure about the guy with Raynauds	 because that tends to be an environmentally triggered vasospasm with both hypo and hyper-perfusion states but typically normal blood flow. Dehydration and Thyroid problems seem perfectly possible. The underlying reasons for the dehydration or lack of oils may be dietary (vitamin deficiency)	 or some sort of metabolic problem.

post_6817810	post_3026105	"I also have wrinked fingers.    It started after receiving my 12 th dose of chemotherapy.    The oxaplatin chemo drug's side effects include neuropathy of the hands and feet. Another side effect is it drys out the skin etc.    So I know my wrinked fingers are related to my chemotherapy.

My Crestor didn't cause my neuropathy	 my Chemotherapy definetely caused it.    I've been off Chemo for some 6 months and am currently experiencing fingertip and foot neuropathy and also wrinked fingers (with even the blood vessel's popping out from the finger!

Maybe even a wheat issue on top of that and a need for a diet change. I am going to do a Candida cleanse and see what happens. I am considering going off the Buproprian anyway soon so I assume it will be a process of elimination. I also started taking more magnesium and B 100 complex along with a multivitamin."	0

post_7655564	post_3026105	"I am a 40 yr old female with celiac disease and I too have a problem with my fingertips wrinkling. I have been trying to figure out the cause of this for a few years but I haven't had any help from drs. I noticed that my fingers are wrinkled more often when exposed to cold temps. My hands are usually cold because I suffer from iron-deficient anemia and I do not like taking iron supplements because they make me constipated. I recently started taking Novartis Slow Fe and I haven't noticed any shriveling of my fingertips for over week. Little known fact---when the body is cold	 blood will bypass extremities in order to maintain homeostasis (equilibrium	 normal body temp) in vital organs... My theory: a symptom of low iron is cold hands. Because my iron was low	 my hands were always cold which resulted in a lower volume of blood in my fingertips as my blood was concentrated in other areas causing a wrinkled appearance on my fingertips. I think anyone with this issue should have there iron levels checked."	0
post_7671523	post_3026105	"I m an engineer (not a Doctor) and find this discussion interesting.    I would like to add my own subjective analysis.    It would seem this is not a single cause single effect type of problem	 but a multiple cause single effect problem.    Many contributing factors may be involved and the question may be asked; what behaviors are aggravating the condition.The Health and Nutrition Causes:    Studies do show we are healthy fat deficient.    Good sources of this are the omega 3 food sources such as Salmon	 Chia Seeds	 Flax Seeds	 and Walnuts.    Chia seeds also provide high source of magnesium along with raw cashews.    Avocados and Coconut Oil provides excellent sources of healthy fats.    A good fish oil or Krill oil are excellent supplements for Omega 3.Prescribed Medications Causes:    Many people are on blood pressure medications and diuretics are known to deplete the body of its essential electrolytes	 besides the intended sodium	 magnesium and    potassium    are depleted as well	 which ironically are all needed to maintain healthy blood pressure.    Staten drugs are known to deplete the body of COQ10.Toxins Causes:    Coconut oil makes an excellent skin lotion	 avoiding the parabens and sulfates	 toxins	 etc.	 found in many skin lotions.    What toxins out there affecting the quality of the skin is an ongoing hotly debated issue	 who knows what the total sum of these toxins are doing to us?Behavior Related Causes:    The accumulated effects of constant Keyboard fingering is interesting and may aggravate the condition	 it seems logical.    Although one would expect all the finger tips to be evenly effected.    The typewriter was invented middle 19th century and we would also expect to see similar effects during this time especially since a typewriter key requires a stronger strike force.Gender Related Behaviors:    Since the majority of stated concerns are coming from women (not just because they are more honest about personal health)	 is there a behavior more typical of women than men that may point the finger at the fingers.    Yes	 I_  m talking about shopping.    But not in the shopping isles themselves but at the cash register.    A little known scientific fact is that the thermal printers at thecash register use BPA to seal the ink to the paper.    You expose your skin this toxin every time you handle a receipt.    There is ongoing research on this hot topic and you will have to do your homework	 but here is an interesting quote from a Medical doctor leading research on this.    _  A study in Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry found that of 13 thermal printing papers (the type often used for receipts) analyzed	 11 contained BPA. Holding the paper for just 5 seconds was enough to transfer BPA onto a person's skin	 and the amount of BPA transferred increased by about 10 times if the fingers were wet or greasy._      http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/12/22/bpa-exposure-health-problem.aspx .In addition	 many food manufacturers use BPA to coat the inside of tin cans to prevent bacterial growth and extend shelf life.

post_8022536	post_3026105	"Interesting and very long thread - a bit frustrating for a slow reader like me but interesting nonetheless. Yes I have all the same symptoms. Started a year ago with small and painful splits and wrinkles brought on by what I thought was from weeding the garden with bare hands	 usually in the mornings when the plants are wet. I thought I might have picked up a fungus or something. Live a healthy life	 no medical issues	 take omega 3 and saw palmetto supplements	 60 yr. male. Exposure to water seemed to definitely exacerbate the wrinkling. Bag Balm worked marvelously to heal the splits but never got rid of it. Diaper rash ointment (zinc oxide) seemed to work a bit but it turns the skin around my gold wedding ring black. Tried changing my diet by stopping certain foods like tea	 coffee	 vitamins but all to no effect.My sister claimed she had it and it stopped when she and her family went on a gluten free diet for her daughter who has celiac disease. While camping in damp weather I it got real bad. Didn't have have cold hands though. I tried a gazillion different things and finally what worked best so far - at times almost perfect hands is: first to disinfect your hands with hand sanitizer. Then apply O'Keeffe's Working Hands cream available at TSC in Canada and possibly Tractor Supply Co. in USA. Also available from Lee Valley Tools by mail order. And I then sprinkle on extra strength Gold Bond power (zinc oxide 5% and menthol 0.8%). I do this definitely before going to bed and in the morning all looks great. Badger Balm also works but not quite as well and smells nice. So based on this the topical disease ie fungus or bacteria might be an explanation also.I think that it also could be symptomatic of emotional stress in general. I know that the tingling is a symptom of that for sure. My stress levels have been high lately	 ie I have also been getting panic attacks lately which is very weird. So I should change my lifestyle and remove stressors from my life. I'll also try a gluten free diet. I will also start watching the BPA -- Bisphenol A used to make hard plastics -- contact and will try the Burt's Bees Soap. Saw that at Lee Valley too.

I read to take a cool shower in the morning-didn't help me. Gel deo. just made it worst. And finally I decided that maybe I should talk with a doctor. That's when I was diagnosed with primary focal hyperhydrosis. I have never heard of this before. It doesn't effect you're health and the only symptom of it is sweating in a particular spot on both sides of you're body-such as under both arms. And nothing will take it away totally	 there may be a few things that can HELP	 but not keep you dry. You can be cold and still sweat	 maybe not as much as if you were hot	 but still sweat. There are no medications for this and will probably never go away-I will just have to find my own cures or deal with it for the rest of my life which is awful because it keeps me from so much! You may want to check with a doctor to see if this is what you have. I noticed you mentioned that you're health is great but that has nothing to do with this. Neither is it a symptom of this. So you can't tell by you're health. I hope this isn't what it is because noone should ever have to go through this! Hopefully you will find something that helps	 and if you do please let me know!

post_2084687	post_2046707	"Hi.    It is not clear to me what the results of your mother's ER/PR and HER-2 assays are	 so I can't give a definite answer to your question if she's going to have difficulties with her medication.    What I'm going    to do is explain a little about those tests.The ER/PR assay measures the amount of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in cancer cells.    The implication is that cancer cells with high levels of ER and PR are susceptible to hormonal treatment aimed at opposing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on those cells.    Conversely	 cancer cells with low ER/PR levels grow independently of estrogen stimulation	 and therefore would be resistant to the effects of hormonal treatment.    Because of this resistance	 tumors with low ER/PR levels may have a poorer outcome than those with high levels.HER-2 is a receptor found on the surface of breast cancer cells. It accepts stimulatory growth signals from a substance called epidermal growth factor.    The HER-2 assay measures the amount of HER-2 on the surface of cancer cells.    Tumors with high levels of HER-2 are usually more aggressive than HER-2 negative types and they may be resistant to certain kinds of chemotherapy.    HER-2 positive cancers    may have a poorer outcome compared to those that are negative for this test. Fortunately	 there is already a drug in the market called trastuzumab which specifically targets this type of breast cancer.If your mother is ER/PR negative and HER-2 positive	 she may have difficulty with certain medication in the sense that her tumor would have resistance to hormonal treatment and certain types of chemotherapy.    But this does not mean that it is not possible for her to get effective treatment.    Newer chemotherapeutic agents	 together with trastuzumab have been proven to be very effective against this type of breast cancer."	0
post_2167969	post_2046707	"Hi	ER	PR	HER-2-NEU are all    tumour markers in breast cancer cells. Any specimen of breast tumour excised is also tested for these markers in addition to the routine histopathology examination.Has already explained about these markers	 let's not go into their details.The main purpose of these marker analysis is to prescribe medication during follow up.They are useful in determining the prognosis of the individual.Rather than causing any difficulty	 they aid in prescribing drugs."	0

Unfortunately	 they often harm your body in the process. There are natural supplements that do a good job of killing cancerous cells	 but don't cause harm to your body. A few supplements do have potential to be toxic to the body	 and should probably just be used in conjunction with a naturopath or alternative doctor. These include cesium	 artemisia	 and B17. In this report you will learn only about completely safe cancer supplements that can be used with no supervision.You may well ask why 	 if a safe and natural product is able to kill cancer	 doesn't your doctor recommend it. Of course	 he probably doesn't know about it	 but even if he did	 he's not likely to use it.It's the nature of the medical/drug industry. Doctors use and recommend drugs that are approved in a process that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The drug companies only make drugs that can be patented. That way they can sell them for huge mark-ups and have no competition.Lady00712/10/07ALL    Did you know that CAT SCANS are equivalent to 400 chest xrays in Radiation.Did you know that TAXOL kills veins and cripples the area where its been administered....Did you know that HERCEPTIN 2 gives your cardiotoxidity...weakens your HEART...TAXOL combined with HER2 Govt approved only if you take HER2 WITH TAXOL...wow    That sounds like blackmail..Their aim is to kill you one way or the other.Lady00712/10/07ALL    After feeling three lumps in my left breast last december 2006.    They did a mamogram(mammogram)on the breast and you could see the lumps quiet clear.    I then went on to have the biopsy which was via Ultra sound visual system by which you could see the lumps quiet clear again.    These lumps turned out to be grade 3 Cancer	 which had infected two lympnodes.     I then had surgery after nuclear dye had been administered to keep the Doc on track when removing my breast and finding all the supposed infected areas. The surgeon took 15 lympnodes plus the sentinal gland in this operation along with the whole breast removal.    It was the ongoing treatment that had me rather bewildered as to the system of which followed.    I was hit with AC x 4 Cyclophosphamide	 Amend	 Granistron	 Hydrochlorid	 and    Dexamethasone [sent my sugar levels sky high spent week in hospital with that] with maxalon to stabalize my system and diabetic 2 medications.    This was only in the first 4 treatments at 3 week intervals.    Then HER2 combined with TAXOL another 4 treatments...Now I am down onto HER2 on its own...My heart rate first up was 38% next 42% next 47% the next test is pending.    I have decided that if the heart does not come up over 50% next test that my treatment should be stopped.    I need an opinion here?Lady00712/10/07ALL    To my way of thinking my breast should have been hit with radiation to shrink the cancer berfore surgery was administered.    Thus giving a more direct approach to the cancer via the surgeon.    Then when the wound was healed I should have been hit again with radiation.    Then to complete the process of doses of HER2 on its own....In my opinion...too many mistakes have been made on this problem with not enough thought gone into it...I also need an opionion here?Lady00712/11/07ALL    http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/doctoring1.htmlCORRUPT PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

I was thinking maybe (too obvious??) that since the thyroid is part of the auto immune system that maybe my immune system was just in shock or something	 but maybe that is not right? I mean	 I know that a surgery of any kind suppresses your immune system	 and causes your whole body to weaken	 but I was just grasping for something.I came out of the surgery well	 no complications	 got right back to the gym working out	 eating well and so forth. Right off the bat i started getting sick alot. I have gone on sort of a cycle of being well for a week or so and sick for 2 weeks then well	 then sick	 and so on.I also babysit a little guy	 he is 7 mos old now and I have watched him since he was a newborn.

Talking scrubbing down with bleach or disinfectant cleaners... stripping all the beds and bleaching sheets	 wiping down doorknobs	 lightswitches	 telephones... all that stuff. I hate to be    a total freak but I cannot keep getting sick like this. I am soooo tired of it. :O(Overall I feel pretty good	 even with my TSH jumping up so high like it has	 so the only thing holding me down is that I keep getting sick all the time.Right now I take several meds and teas.

post_4576231	post_4576175	"Hey	 Shell. You really need a sleep study. That will at least document what's going on with you and give you more credibility with your doctor	 be it PCP or neuro.Assuming nothing is blocking your breathing	 etc.	 you could get a script for some kind of med that has somnolence as a side effect. There are quite a few	 particularly psychiatric ones	 where a small dose might do the trick. In my experience	 Ambien and Lunesta lose their effectiveness after a while.Believe me	 I sympathize	 since I have insomnia much of the time. I've done a lot of Googling about this	 and have found next to nothing that says insomnia is a primary effect of MS. Lots about how pain can keep you awake	 etc.	 etc.	 but little that says an MS lesion can be the culprit in itself. Perhaps sleep is too complex a function for that. I sure don't understand the science.During the past few days I've had sort of a sleep marathon. Get up	 do the basics	 and zonk out again. This sort of thing happens to me once in a great while	 just to punctuate the usual poor sleep routine	 for some reason.You just can't keep running on empty	 so badger your doctors for help. It's dangerous for you physically	 mentally and emotionally.

It's painless if you don't mind being wired to all those electrodes measuring your evry movement and breath.    It might hold some clues for you.In the meantime	 think about doing a sleep hygiene checklist too - the dos and don'ts that make for a good sleep experience.

Underlying mechanisms remain unknown	 but psychosocial factors may play an important role.""So my question....is the fatigue and sleep problems caused by MS or depression?This article left me a bit confused.    We know that depression is high in those with MS (or for that matter in most chronic medical conditions)    and I wager to say	 those even going through ""limboland;."" but I think that depression is a very small component of the day time fatigue and the trouble of getting to sleep at night.I think it has do with the ""haywire"" going on in our brains	 most probably caused by lesions and the havoc they create.

post_4580756	post_4576175	"I thought that line might cause confusion.    I hope I can phrase this clearly because it is hard.    When the study says that insomnia is associated with depression	 they aren't saying that insomnia is ""caused by depression.""    Multiple studies have looked at fatigue	 sleep problems and such and tried to see if they ""correlate"" with any of the markers in MS such as physical disability	 cognitive difficulties	 mood disorders and such.    The only thing that they find a statistical correlation with is depression.This does not say that all people with insomnia have depression or vice versa.    But	 it does give a clue into what possibly is giving rise to the sleep/fatigue problems.    The same kind of neurotransmitter problems that cause depression may cause the insomnia or sleep disruption.That is why I mentioned possibly using an anti-depressant that has drowsiness as a side effect.

post_4582355	post_4576175	"Much that I have read about MS indicates that MSers typically do have sleep issues involving both	 diminished quality and quantity of sleep.    In other words	 sleep issues are to be expected in people with MS.I had a sleep study done:    Now I'm on CPAP (for obstructive sleep apnea) which helped me for about a year and a half	 but now I'm starting to have some bad nights again.    I have an adjustable bed and sleep best in a sitting position.My sleep doctor emphasized that preparation for sleep should begin about two hours before bedtime.    You should dim the lights then	 don't go out in any sunlight	 and generally start chilling out.    Too many people go from action to sleep time - thinking they can just turn off all the stimulation and go to sleep immediately.    It usually won't work that way.    Don't watch a stimulating TV show or read a chapter book that leaves you hanging in suspense.Also my sleep MD emphasized that there should not be any recreational items such as a computer or a TV in your bedroom.    Your bedroom should ONLY be associated with sleep.    No treadmills	 no exercise bikes	 no desk piled high with bills should be in your bedroom.    Only your bed and related furniture so your body associates that room with sleep!!    Also	 you should have total darkness when going to sleep - either by blackout drapes or some kind of comfortable sleep mask.You should go to bed and get up at essentially the same times every day.Hope the above helps you.

But Im so happy that I am not the only one. Ive read everything you guess have to say and I will try a few of your ideas. I have some sea salt that I use to clean my lips rings and it really works and makes them not smell so I might try that. if it works Ill let you know. Thanks for the help.:]"	0
post_2443898	post_117452	my belly button started to smell when i was pregnant. i figured it would go away after my pregnancy and my son is two years old now    and it still smells horrible.    so i just clean it out with an alcohol swab.    i went to the doctor and she didnt seem to care.	0
post_2454145	post_117452	I just turned 19 and I started noticing my belly button started to smell a few months back. I didnt know what was going on. I asked my friend/roommate if hers was like that. She said no but maybe I should clean it with alcohol so i did but that didnt work. I havent been to the doctor sine like 9th grade and I am a freshman in college now. It doesnt smell really loud but if I am like just rubbing my finger in it then i smell it. And when I clean it with a q-tip there's like brown discharge on it. I don't know what to do. My doctor isnt even here he's in my hometown. Any suggestion? Please help. My e-mail is ***@****	0

post_2590651	post_117452	"I know the answer!I used to have that kind of issue	 but now I have the solution. Olive oil! It's really good and natural. Don't use any chemical thing to clean your belly hole that will hurt you	 since your belly hole is still accecced to your stomach. And if you cleaned so hard	 you will had a stomachache.How to: Use tissue or similar thing to dip into the olive oil	 then use it to clean your belly hole.You can use other oil too	 but olive oil has a strong smell that can remove the stinky smell. On the other hand	 it has the function of clean	 so it can remove the dirty thing and bacterias. In China	 we believe olive oil is ""warm"" oil	 so it can reduce the chance to have a stomachache. If you still have	 that's ok	 drink some hot coffee and the next day the symdrom will disappear!If you would like to know more please contact me at ***@****"	1

I'm 55 and when I was a little girl once mom asked me if I had had my hands down my pants (it smelled like poop) and I don't think she believed me when I told her it was my belly button that I had just cleaned the ""crust"" off of it.Mine too gets a yellowish/brown discharge that dries to a crust and is smelly.    I also have an ""Inny"".	 have had a C-section	 tubes tied	 and a hysterectomy	 and am a little overweight.

post_2652341	post_117452	"hello guys	i have just read everyone's entries and like all yourselves	 i suffer from the awful smell and gunk from the belly button.i am an overweight 21 year old and my belly fat rolls up so the belly button doesn't get any air to it and makes it damp and moist and very smelly.i used to have a belly button piercing but took it out after 2 months cos my body rejected it and now the hole has closed up but there is a huge red rash and scab above it and sore red thrush-like symptoms around the inner belly button. it itches and is very sore.i went to the doctors and was diagnosed with fungal infection and they prescribed me an antifungal cream called daktacort (you can purchase on internet 15g for  __5).the cream has helped immensely.to avoid the smell coming back	 shower daily and always clean the belly button out and make sure you dry it properly.also try sprinkling some 'mycil powder' around the hole to stop it from sweating. normal talcum powder is fine but because mycil powder treats athlete's foot and fungal infection	 it could be the better option to get rid of nasty infections and odors.

post_2653952	post_117452	"For years on and off my belly button has smelled.    I do have a ring	 but even before I got it it smelled sometimes... I think the solution is simple...

Its usually when Im in a rush and I get dressed as soon as I get out the shower.    I think it's the lack of air and the water.

We all have yeast on our bodies - these little crevices that don't get aired out regularly have a tendency to create these wonderful little environments for yeast to take over when our body chemistry changes ever so slightly.

post_3089776	post_117452	"I have a very deep belly button that has been infected several times over the past 7/8 years.    Oddly	 it seems to be set off by travel - I suppose sitting in the plane and dealing with jetlag affect my body chemistry	 which functions as a trigger of some sort.    In any case	 I went to see many doctors - some gave me creams	 some told me to leave it alone	 some told me that it was my fault for poking around too much.    I never saw blood in my navel	 but I did have a strange	 off-white discharge with a foul odor.The infection always cleared up eventually but it was bothersome	 uncomfortable	 and embarrassing.    I thought I was alone until I came across this posting.I wanted to share the best remedy I have found in my years of dealing with this inconvenient (but ultimately	 not very serious) condition.    Stop with all the harsh products.    If you have a deep belly button	 the skin down there is sensitive and putting hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol in it	 is more likely to aggravate the symptoms than it is to cure them.    Also	 stop sticking q-tips and cotton balls down there	 they can leave behind traces of cotton that can also aggravate your condition.    I was annoyed when one doctor told me this	 but	 I often noticed that my problem seemed to get worse if I attacked too aggressively.What has worked best for me is to take a glass of warm salt water and place the glass over my belly button.    I swish it around for awhile with the glass held over the navel	 than pour some of the liquid from the glass into my navel; then I swish what's left in the glass around again and drain all the contents of the glass into and over my navel area.    Finally	 I take the shower head and very quickly rinse the area	 careful to make sure that I don't rinse all the salt water out of my belly button.    When I get out of the shower	 I take a piece of toilet paper and pat my navel	 to make sure excess moisture is absorbed.    I DO NOT STICK ANYTHING IN TO MAKE SURE IT'S DRY.Within a few days (one week max)	 this is sure to clear up any problems (unless they are more serious).    It's the best way I've found to combat recurring belly button infections	 and it makes sense that it works.    Salt water is a gentle disinfectant that won't upset the delicate balance of your body's chemistry.This has worked consistently and well for me.I hope it helps someone else out there.Good luck.b.b."	1

I spoke with a nurse and she confirmed that it was more than likely a yeast infection and that keeping it clean and dry was the best way to combat it.    She told me to only worry if anything became red and itchy	 and that it was sooooo common!    She also confirmed that I shouldn't stick anything into my belly button	 that a washcloth soaked in warm soapy water would work wonders	 and to keep using the body powder as necessary."	0

post_3260287	post_117452	"I looked at this website when I was having a problem with a foul smelling discharge from my belly button.    I tried all of the things everyone else has (but didn't go to the MD).    I have found an extremely simple solution to the problem I had.Unless you have a physical deformity or reason for your navel to become infected	 it is probably a ""yeast-like"" substance that grows because of the warmth and moisture of the navel.The one thing that cures yeast-like infections is yogurt with active cultures (which is in more store brand yogurts).    Eat a container of yogurt everyday until it's gone and then a couple of times a week to keep it from returning.    If you don't like the taste of yogurt	 you can apply it directly	 but I cannot guarantee that will be as effective because you just simply can't get a whole container in your navel!    So even if you don't like it	 I recommend eating it anyway.Yogurt has also been shown to cure/prevent yeast infections in other areas of the body including the vagina.If after eating yogurt for a week or so	 the infection doesn't clear up - then go to the doctor and make sure some other therapies aren't needed.So eat up and be healthy everyone!!!"	1
post_3266984	post_117452	My doctor told me that she sees this in both very slim and very overweight people and that she is seeing this more often.    Use salt water only to clean your belly button.    According to my doc this is nothing more than    an aggrevation but to someone who suffers with this it is more than that. I have had no adominal(abdominal)surgery nor do I have periods and I eat a lot of yogurt and it has not helped me.    I think this is just another affliction of women.	0

post_3395632	post_117452	"So	 I apparently have a very deep bellybutton	 which in my case has nothing to do with weight (I have a pretty average build). But I have had occasional bellybutton infections before	 which are painful and gross.Usually--even without an infection--there is some amount of odor to my bellybutton. Not a ton like some of the others here have posted	 but enough to annoy me!The advice I received from my doctor was actually to avoid getting it wet if possible	 and definitely not to get soap and other cleansing agents in it. Keeping things dry as possible is key! So anyway	 I'm not sure what to make of the advice some of you are reporting here--you might want to be careful which remedies you try.Anyway	 I am nine months pregnant right now	 and my bellybutton is SO deep that I still have an innie! Isn't that crazy? Most pregnant ladies I know	 their bellybuttons disappear in pregnancy or even turn into outies. But not me.What's interesting is that my bellybutton is now more of a normal size. As it's been sort of unfolding open	 I've had the very unusual opportunity to clean up some of the crud that's been caked in there forever.Tonight	 I was doing more of the same and getting some yuckiness out	 when I saw something. It looks like I have a very small cyst or polyp in there! It's a little growth of skin	 very tiny	 but very much attached to the inside wall of my bellybutton. I am wondering if the occasions on which I've had actual infections have had to do with the existence of this little tag of flesh and perhaps it getting irritated or something.Anyway	 if I *weren't* nine months pregnant	 I wouldn't be able to see it. But unfortunately	 because I'm nine months pregnant	 I'm not exactly in a position to run out to a doctor and ask about having it looked at/removed.Has anyone else got any experience with learning they have a cyst or polyp or whatever you call it in their bellybutton? Maybe this is something I can have a doctor look at in a few months.... Hmmm. Because if it IS the source of the actual painful infections	 I want it GONE	 you know? :)"	0

post_3403938	post_117452	"I think that like any other ailment	 the stinky belly button can be caused not only by one	 but several factors.    The main problem is having a deep belly button	 or one that gets little air (due to being overweight or other such factors as tight unbreatheable clothing).    Yeast	 fungus	 and anaerobic bacteria are all possible causes	 depending on the person.    Anaerobic bacteria thrive in spaces with little or no oxygen.    Yeast and fungus like moist environments.    People with deep belly buttons or ones that have a lot of fat or clothing covering their belly buttons have a higher chance of harboring the organisms.    Unless you can get a culture	 it's hard to pinpoint what organism is causing your belly button distress. If you do find out what organism is in there	 you can then treat it accordingly	 i.e.	 antibiotics	 yogurt	 etc.    Another thing that helps harbor those organisms is when your immune system becomes compromised somehow	 i.e.	 due to stress	 medication	 or other illness	 it is not able to fend off the ""bad"" organisms as well	 so they can easily proliferate on your body.    Also	 a change in the body's pH	 even slightly	 can help the microbes to grow.    This may be the case for those of you who experience the stinkiness around the time of your period	 as your body's pH changes slightly.    It's also possible for stinky belly buttons to be caused by an umbilical hernia	 cysts	 or other cuts/abrasions in the hole.    Each person is different	 and because there are so many reasons for infections to occur	 there is no one explanation for the stinky belly button syndrome.    I hope this helps a little.    I	 too	 have a stinky belly button	 but it doesn't sound as severe as most people's.    I am not overweight	 but I have a deep belly button	 and I am on immunosupressants.    What I find helps is I gently	 and I do mean gently	 clean most if not all the crust inside my belly button	 then swab with a q-tip dipped in alcohol only when it starts to stink really bad.    I would not recommend this for everyday	 as alcohol is toxic to your cells	 and can actually aggravate your belly button."	1

post_3693482	post_117452	"The following is from an emedicine article.    It is very technical	 but it demonstrates that there are many different possibilities for the problems you are having:""Patients with umbilical disorders present with drainage	 a mass	 or both. Most umbilical disorders result from failure of normal embryologic or physiologic processes. Unusual umbilical anatomy	 such as a single umbilical artery or abnormal position of the umbilicus	 may be associated with other congenital anomalies or syndromes.Omphalocele and gastroschisis	 which are common abdominal wall defects associated with the umbilicus	 are discussed in other eMedicine articles (see Omphalocele and Gastroschisis). Masses of the umbilicus may be related to lesions of the skin	 embryologic remnants	 or an umbilical hernia. Masses associated with the skin include dermoid cysts	 hemangiomas	 and inclusion cysts. Umbilical drainage is associated with granulomas and embryologic remnants.Delayed separation of the umbilical cord: The umbilical cord usually separates from the umbilicus 1-8 weeks postnatally. Topical antimicrobials are usually applied after delivery	 followed by isopropyl alcohol until cord separation. Delayed separation may signify an underlying immune disorder.Umbilical granuloma: Granulation tissue may persist at the base of the umbilicus after cord separation. The tissue is composed of fibroblasts and capillaries and can grow to more than 1 cm. Umbilical granulomas must be differentiated from umbilical polyps	 which do not respond to silver nitrate cauterization.Umbilical infections: Patients with omphalitis may present with purulent umbilical discharge or periumbilical cellulitis. Although infections may be associated with retained umbilical cord or ectopic tissue	 in the past	 infections were often related to poor hygiene. Current aseptic practices and the routine use of antimicrobials on the umbilical cord have reduced the incidence to less than 1%. Cellulitis may become severe within hours and progress to necrotizing fasciitis and generalized sepsis.Omphalomesenteric remnants: Persistence of all or portions of the omphalomesenteric duct can result in fistulas	 sinus tracts	 cysts	 congenital bands	 and mucosal remnants. Patients with mucosal remnants can present with an umbilical polyp or within an umbilical cyst.Urachal remnants: The developing bladder remains connected to the allantois through the urachus.

It lasts about a week	 crusts up	 then goes away for a couple weeks.    It is absolutely repulsive.    I have always been average weight	 very healthy	 and have not been pregnant for 7 years.    I have tried cleaning and drying it really well but that doesn't help.    In thinking I was irritating it	 I've tried leaving it alone but that didn't help either.    I don't understand why this would suddenly happen to me 2 years ago out of nowhere.    I read the tea tree oil suggestion so I will try that.    If that doesn't help	 I suppose I will have to put aside my embarassment and see a doctor."	0
post_3803160	post_117452	"I'm so happy to find this site I've had so many tragedies lately that I about come unglued when I found a discharge coming from my belly button that was part blood	black junk	and milky white discharge and sore also red I thought something may have been ruptured or it was a sign of cancer.I see I can calm down that its not life threatening but that I still need to see my doctor to see what it might be.I've never had this problem till a few months ago when I started losing weight only the sore belly button and to beat it all I don't have a deep belly button at all its rather shallow but since I started losing weight its gotten deeper so that maybe why the discharge has started more room now for water to settle into I guess.But I'm happy I found this website it has eased my fears greatly."	0

Granted we all know not to put anything in our craters	 however	 i think this can be granted an exception to the rule...

post_3905136	post_117452	I have had a smelly belly button on and off for years.    Sometimes I also get pain internally around the belly button area.    Sometimes it gets red and inflamed and has gunk inside.    I seem to have a really deep almost never-ending belly button!    Anyway I find just putting some savlon on a q-tip inside the belly button does the trick.I am going to ask my doctor about it anyway because I think I may have allergies to certain foods such as wheat and I believe Thrush and Wheat infections both relate to Candida bacteria which an excess of can cause Thrush?	0
post_3943261	post_117452	Wow so many people with the same problem...whew thought it was only me...I am a little overweight but I have also noticed it is more noticable after having sex or around time for my period...I asked my doctor and he said it was more than likely yeast caused by not enough air getting to my belly button and told me to try eating yogurt..Even though I hate yogurt I did eat it till it went away and I eat one cup of yogurt once a week and it seems to keep it cleared up.	1
post_3950554	post_117452	"I am a guy with the same problem. I think part of the reason is that I had my gall bladder out a few years ago and for the operation they put a tube through the belly button	 so it isn't nearly as open as it used to be	 in fact its become just a deep smelly crack. I don't usually notice the smell because it is so closed off to the outside air	 and I forget to wash it. But my God	 if I put my finger there or happen to be in a position in which it comes open - smells like something died in there! I found alcohol makes it sting too much. Liquid soap and then a little oil helps for a while. Mostly	 I just have to remember to wash and dry it I guess.I have a lot of trouble with fungal infections in the skin	 so maybe I should try some of the cream I have for that too."	0

post_3997693	post_117452	"After reading many of the comments on here	 there was one thing that has not been mentioned (not that I noticed	 anyway). I have the same problem and suspect that it's a nickel allergy. I always get an odor after wearing jeans with metal buttons. And many of you mentioned surgeries and or piercings	 which according to the sites I found	 can lead to overexposure to nickel and thus the sensitivity. Other than attempting to buy nickel-free items	 you can use clear fingernail polish to coat the    buttons	 sew on different (wood/plastic) buttons	 or buy a nickel-testing kit to find out if the items you possess contain nickel. I haven't tried any of these yet	 but it seems the fingernail polish seems to be an easy solution to try.

post_4072253	post_117452	"Im a male and I have the same problem. I have a discharge from my belly button that comes and goes. It usually is a light discharge but sometimes heavy. Its a mixture of light pink blood with gunky	 puss looking liquid with a really bad infectious smell. Ive had this for over 10 years now but it only happens for a week or two and goes away for months at a time. I get a little pain there too. I had two of my doctors (gastro doc and general doc) look at it and they dont seem to think it is anything serious. My gastro doc sent me to a micro surgeon and he basically said it was a common thing from birth where the belly button never really healed properly from the umbilical cord. He cleaned it out and caterized (spelling?) it. This was last year. since then	 it has happened twice. I was laying in bed last night and happened to pass my hand across my stomach and felt crust. I used cotton balls and found the smelly gunk with some blood again. Im not sure if I really beleive that its just a birth thing because its smells like an infection and there is blood. I actually feel mentally out of it when this happens and a little weak it times. Not sure if its related to it but it seems like it is. I have a doctors appointment tomoro with a new doctor and that will be my topic of discussion. Ill come back here to offer some more input after i see my doctor."	0
post_4096712	post_117452	"Hi Mike79	I too am a male who suffers from this horrid	 putrid stench. What I find works best is to dab a small amount (about 10 ml's) of hydrochloric acid into my belly button. Sure it burns a bit	 but it is better than the embarrasment of having your wife tell you that she refuses to perform orally for you because the rotting stink of your wretched	 disgusting and almost satanic smell is making her gag while she comes within inches of your stink pot. After the acid burn the smell seems to go away for quite a while. I only have to use it about twice a year now. Very much worth the discomfort of caustic liquid eating away the smelly skin to receive a moist	 warm	 heart felt bout of oral pleasure. If you can't find any hydrochloric acid	 try using bromine."	1
post_4111021	post_117452	"I have been to the doctor about this same thing last fall. I thought a green pool brought this brown/yellow discharge to a head. After a month I went to my primary and he gave me antibiotics and a script for some cream to apply. It didn't work at all. Matter of fact it seems worse at times now than it did in the beginning when it first happened after the pool. Oh the doc also said may be an abscess or a cyst.I read mention of a weight issue? I too am over weight	 but when I wasn't over weight while at work one night I took a    bathroom break (this was March in 1986) my belly button was really sore not a painful but a burning irritation sore. I to stuck my finger in there and pulled out a yellow plug like I don't know what	 about an inch in length. I was grossed out. It looked like the filter of nasty yellowed cigarette butt. But I had no problems after that night until last fall when at night I sat in a green watered pool. I couldn't see it was green.I frankly don't know what else to do. I had a taint of blood last week that left a dried ring in the morning.    I don't know but obviously if I found that plug when I was 70lbs smaller and fit as a fiddle I don't think we can say weight is a factor."	0

Don't understand why or how	 but it happens	 maybe the body is weak and cannot fight it as good as it use to	 who knows.    But the doctor told me I had body yeast infection	 he said it could spread to other parts of your body if not taken care of .    So even if you have a vaginal yeast infection take care of it right away because that too can spread.    So after the medication the stinky belly button went away too.    Also I am borderline diabetic now and feel that is why my resistance that I had earlier in life is causing me to have these yeast infections.

He prescribed Lotrisone Cream and it took care of the problem until it is that time of the month when women starts bloating and pushes the belly button out a bit causing water to trapped in the belly when the belly goes back to normal after your cycle.    If you don't want to go to the doctor's for a prescription	 over the counter bacitracin works just as well.

And i was told it small operation to fix this.And i just want to mention the doctor in Baku said this desease is occurs very seldom	 Even though you see here a lot of people haveing the same problem still this is not much	 so very are a seldom case.But i didnt belive and wend to doctor in Norway	 since i live here now.

post_5286261	post_117452	I have the same problem (off and on).    It seems to be worse having getting pregnant and gaining a lot of weight.    I found a really great link that offers great advice and help.It's http://hubpages.com/hub/Belly-button-dischargeI really think this should be more of a focal area for research because there are just too many peeps with the same issue and unlike our ears that produce wax and are exposed to air and elements in the air~our belly buttons remain for the most part of the time covered.    I would be interested in learning if having an 'inny' button as opposed to an 'outty' has any signifigance in health issues.    Like one member I think named Mike said he does feel kinda weak at times when there is discharge and I also have noticed the same correlation but blew it off because I figured I'm twirling a toothpick in a very delicate area and honestly I don't want to have my guts start leaking out or something since it is such a 'mysterious' area.    And I'm beginning to think the doctors are only as good as their instructor and how dedicated they were to learn about the human body during college while cramming for exams and just getting through the hoops to get that piece of paper that says now you can dedicate sleepless nights as an intern.    You get my drift. We have to pull together as people with the same problem and formulate our own method to finding the cause(s) and connections and hopefully a cure to prevent it from reoccurring.	1

post_5328314	post_117452	"Hi Guys. I a overwieght and I get b/button probs. I have a solution that is cheap	 simple and iradicates smell. Afterthe shower and that must be every day	 dry the area with a q tip very gently so as not to disturb the delicate skin. When it gets sore use a couple of drops of tea tree oil with abase oil or an egg cup full of warm water. Wipe the soulotion round inside with a bud untill bad smell is gone. Then dry it with another	 the skin inside is delicate so be careful and nice and gentle. Tea tree oil is a naturally drying oil so et it do its thing. one go at this should be enough but if not repeat again each night until its gone. I also find a little powder in thee after you have dried it after the shower helps stop in coming in the first place. Good luck to all those poor little pink belly buttons.Ani69"	1

post_5373613	post_117452	"I actually have had the same issues for many many years.    I would always clean the area well	 check to see if it's stronger during my cycle and everything.    The smell is so bad and so was the crusting.    In 2006 after finally discussing it with my Physician	 he scheduled me for a CT Scan.    For me the results were that I had a cyst the size of a golf ball on the umbilical cord.    He scheduled me for surger to remove it and they went into the same location that I had my tubal ligation (minus a few centimeters).    Well after 4 years it's back and now i'm wondering if the cyst is back or as you all have shown me	 it could just be happening.    I also used the fungal cream which never helped at all."	0

post_5544555	post_117452	"For many people	 the belly button is the focal point of their bodies. Your midsection is constantly exposed in summer when you are at the pool or beach. Not only is there pressure to have a nicely toned midsection	 it can be embarrassing if you are emitting a foul odor from your belly button. Some people even get a dark	 whitish	 or clear discharge from their belly button.There are a few conditions that can cause belly button discharge. Patent urachus or a urachal cyst are a couple reasons why you could have belly button discharge. Sometimes people get debris caught inside the belly button. The debris inside the belly button can cause irritation of the skin and lead to an infection. On some people	 an abscess can form and cause a foul-smelling odor. The smell is bacteria that do not use oxygen and produce the foul odors. Your body will send white blood cells to the infection to fight it off and control the infection from worsening. Your doctor may need to perform surgery and prescribe antibiotics if the infection worsens. The infection may also be a yeast infection in the belly button.Patent urachusA surgery called patent urachus will be performed to correct a urachus tube that fails to close after birth. The urachus tube is a small tube that connects the fecal bladder to the umbilical cord. Patent urachus repair is a surgery to close a defect of the bladder. When a baby grows inside the womb	 the urachus will normally close. If the urachus fails to close	 you need to have a surgery performed to close it. Having an abnormal opening between the bladder and the area where the umbilical cord was removed	 will increase the risk for bladder infections.This condition is more common in females than in males. The discharge that drains out of the belly button is actually urine. Surgery for patent urachus will require several days in the hospital. Generally recovery from patent urachus is quick and most people do not experience reoccurring problems. Patent urachus may heal on its own in about two months	 but you will need to watch it closely so it does not get infected. There have been rare cases where it does not heal and it presents a problem later in life. If patent urachus does not heal and reoccurs later in life	 it can reappear as swelling and discharging urine or mucus from a cyst.You may also experience inflamed lumps around the belly button. These lumps that form may cause persistent infection in the individual and it leads to cysts and other things. If you think you have belly button discharge	 you should collect a sample for the doctor to perform laboratory testing on. Your doctor will take a swab of the mucus or liquid when you get to their office and send it away for testing.Urachal cystA urachal cyst is a cyst occurring in a persistent portion of the urachus. It is a large infection that presents itself as a large mass in the umbilical region. If you have a urachal cyst	 you will experience abdominal pain and a fever if it becomes infected. If it bursts	 the fluid will drain through the belly button. A urachal cyst is a rare condition that affects 1 in 2	000 people.In order to treat a urachal cyst	 you need a doctor to lance it. Bactine or hydrogen peroxide will then need to be applied to the cyst several times a day. Use antibacterial soap to cleanse the urachal cyst in the shower.Yeast InfectionSome people who experience belly button discharge may have a yeast infection. A yeast infection is simply an overgrowth of fungus. During a yeast infection	 you may experience painful itching and burning. A yeast infection can be treated with antifungal creams. Some people may need to have a prescription for a yeast infection. There are also home remedies for yeast infections. You can apply plain yogurt to the yeast infection and it will reduce the painful itching you may experience.If your child has a yeast infection on their belly button	 you need to speak with their pediatrician about treatment options. Many children cannot have antifungal creams applied to their stomachs as it may cause further irritation.A yeast infection will cause the belly button to become inflamed and red. It will itch and burn and you will get the urge to scratch. Resist the urge to scratch	 as this only worsens the condition. Instead	 use a cold compress on the belly button area to reduce your need to scratch. Ointments are another great way to reduce the burning and itching sensation of a yeast infection.If you have been treating the yeast infection for at least 7 days and you still are not getting relief	 you need to speak with your doctor. If your yeast infection was properly treated and then returned within 2 months	 you need to speak with a medical professional.ThrushThrush can also occur on the belly button and in the mouth after birth. Thrush is white patches in the mouth and on the tongue. Thrush can appear on other places of the body	 like the belly button. Thrush is a yeast called candida that grows out of control. Thrush usually occurs in babies because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight off the growth of yeast. Elderly individuals also experience thrush as their immune system begins to deteriorate.Thrush looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Generally it looks like you should be able to wipe these patches of whiteness away	 but you can't. You should not attempt to wipe the patches away	 as this will only cause further irritation and make the patches red and sore. A doctor can tell if your baby has thrush by looking at the white patches. For adults	 your doctor may discuss further medical information with you. Your family history will be talked about as it could be linked to something else such as diabetes.Thrush is normally not serious and can be treated with antifungal medicine such as nystatin liquid. You simply put the medication on the white patches and over time they will cease. For a baby with thrush	 they may also develop a diaper rash at the same time. Use some diaper ointment to reduce the rash at the same time you are treating their thrush. Some babies may need nystatin cream for their diaper rash. For an adult	 you will use medicine that is applied directly onto the white patches using a liquid dropper or lozenge. If the nystatin cream doesn't work	 then your doctor may need to prescribe an antifungal pill."	0

post_5891714	post_117452	"My belly button has had a smell for a while. Last week	 I pulled open my belly button as much as possible because I noticed that it was starting to hurt and I saw how red it was inside. Bright red. Really scared me. There was also some clear pus. I bought Clotrimazole (anti-fungal cream for thrush	 jock itch	 athlete's foot	 etc.) and applied a small amount of the cream to the inside of my belly button with a Q-tip twice a day. I am on the 5th day of treatment and the redness is almost completely gone. The pain stopped within 12 hours	 as did the smell. No smell	 no pain	 almost no redness. Seems like this funky belly button problem is just a simple case of thrush from moisture	 bacteria	 and heat. Also	 I have a very deep belly button and I figure that doesn't help matters. If you have this problem	 save yourself the trouble of salt or vinegar baths or whatever else and just buy some OTC anti-fungal cream for $6 or $7."	0

post_6137829	post_117452	**Try Lotrimin AF - it's a powder antifungal spray.    It worked for me!!!!What's interesting is we all have different forms of belly button odor issues.    Some people experience pain with it which I did not. (If you have pain please go see the doctor!)    Some have dark gook etc... I initially contibuted mine back to 2 laperoscopy surgeries (where they go in thru the belly button) then I thought could it be the extra 15 pounds I've put on over the past few years - hard to say.    Mine is not really an innie or an outtie it's just about even with the rest of my stomach.    I started getting daily almost whitish/yellowish crustiness in my belly button that had just a nasty rancid odor (like dead fish) that I could not get rid of.    The are was also irritated and pink.    I tried the peroxide treatment - no luck it just stung.    After reading everyones insights I decided to try a combo treatment.    Lotrimin makes a anti-fungal spray that has a powder in it (also used for jock itch). Within about 2-3 days I was feeling 100 % better. Every so often I will still hit it with the spray just to keep it from coming back. :-)    Seems to me though for anyone who has lumps in the belly button or infection colored discharge whether it be dark (ie: redish/brownish or anything that is oozy I would highly recommend a doctors opinion.    Just remember they've seen it all (and then some). It's not worth years of embarassment when it can most likely be resolved with a simple antibiotic treatment or for me and antifungal spray.

Years later after some dental work that kinda scratched my gums	 the dentist gave PERIDEX mouthrinse. he said it would soothe and bring down the swelling. It did that and as I read up on it it is also used for gum disease infections. it is prescription but very cheap for a big bottle. I soaked a q-tip in it and cleaned out my belly button and just like that the smell went away and never came back. I never knew what kind of infection it was but this worked great. My doc suggested that I share this so I hope it can help others too."	0

Then have them take two q tips to spread it apart and clean it out. Then get doggy style so it all runs out via gravity while you pat it dry. I think my ex wife misses things like this I used to do.    medicine_man_4	0

post_7685465	post_117452	"I'm posting this comment high up the list because my bf had the same thing happening to him	 and after doing a lot of research I found out what it was and how to fix it for good. The cause of the smell is actually from a fungus	 not bacteria	 that invaded the opening of your belly button and is trying to continue spreading down your navel passage. So all the anti-bacterial stuff people do to try and fix it is ineffective	 including taking oral antibiotics which can even make it worse. Too much moisture around the opening is only half the problem for most folks: Take fewer showers (and quit swimming for awhile if that's what you tend to do)	 dry your belly button well	 swab it with alchohol	 and let it dry totally each time. Don't rub the area much at all while washing: you want it to heal itself shut! Keep your belly button as moisture-free as possible at all times to prevent giving the fungus a place to grow. Apply a topical antifungal of your choice to the area at least once a day until symptoms clear. Other than that	 dryness is key! ((I know this sounds icky	 but if you're starting out with ""goo"" in there	 it's best to squeeze it out before beginning treatment.)) That's what you do on the outside. Now for the inside of you:If you tend to love your: coffee	 alcohol	 ibuprofen	 sugar	 stress	 and 'wolfing' your food	 I have bad news. All of these things	 in addition to having insufficient digestive enzymes (evidenced by acid reflux	 etc.)	 actually contribute to your stinky belly button problem; you have to cut back on all of these things significantly in order to heal. These things contribute to a condition called Leaky Gut Syndrome	 in which the yeasts in your digestive tract (natural fungus) run rampant and cause mild inflammation of the small intestine. This inflammation results in porosity of the gut lining	 allowing microbes and even small food particles to leak out of the intestine and into the abdominal cavity. If this Candida yeast gets into your naval tract...viola! Stinky belly button. Soooo....You have to heal your small intestine in order to avoid your belly button problem from recurring. Trust me	 this worked wonders for my bf. Here's how: For two weeks	 avoid the stuff I mentioned just above. Add as much lemon	 lime	 garlic	 ginger	 and vegetables to your diet during this time as you can (it's a good habit to stay in). Chew all your meals and snacks slowly	 limit your portion sizes	 and take digestive enzymes with each meal (usually available in chews). Take probiotics daily (like what's found in live-culture yogurt or in pill form) for the two weeks. Probiotics are naturally found in the intestine	 but get overwhelmed by overgrowth of Candida; you got to replace 'em to put things back in balance. You will also daily want to take an amino acid called glutamine that is fairly tasteless and can be mixed into drinks. Glutamine helps heal your digestive tract so it's important to take it. Take omega-3 fatty acids or eat foods high in them. Staying hydrated and keeping up on your fiber will help flush out the fungus as it dies.If you follow this regimen for two weeks	 then keep up your healthy eating habits	 you will likely never see this problem pop up again. Best of luck!"	1
post_7685577	post_117452	"Well	 I guess my comment didn't post very high up! Anyway	 I just wanted to add a couple of points: Some good external antifungals to try are tea tree oil	 grapefruit seed extract (called GSE)	 Monistat 7 if you have it around	 coconut oil	 apple cider vinegar	 oregano oil	 and clove oil.The particles that escape a leaky gut can cause other health problems such as fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites)	 allergies	 and asthma. When these particles are in the abdomen	 your body's immune system kicks into high gear to rid itself of the foreign object. It's something to consider if you are having immune-related problems or a large gut that doesn't seem to be all fat.Candida yeast is the same as thrush. It's what gives us vaginal yeast infections	 stinky belly buttons	 and that white coating on your tongue. It's favorite food is the sugars we eat and it can get out of control in the body with a high-sugar diet. Other factors that favor yeast growth in our bodies are: chlorine	 flouride	 heavy metals	 antibiotics	 nicotine	 food and beauty chemicals	 having diabetes or AIDS	 and eating processed foods from moldy sources	 like tomato sauce/paste/ketchup and dehydrated potatoes.Some good sources of omega-3: grass fed beef	 walnuts	 oily fish	 cantaloupe	 flax	 safflower oil	 fortified eggs and milk.If you are looking for more healthy foods to steer toward	 try grapefruit	 green apples	 quinoa	 buckwheat	 avocado	 whole grains	 tree nuts	 raw foods	 fermented foods (kim chi	 saurkraut	 kombucha	 tempe)	 yogurt	 and cruciferous veges like brocolli	 kale	 cauliflower	 brussels sprouts	 etc. Steer clear of packaged and fast foods as much as possible and cut back on white starches like potatoes	 rice	 pasta	 corn	 and bread.I hope all this helps someone...it took weeks of research to find the answer for my bf. He went to the doctor for his stinky bellybutton before I met him; the doctor's approach was to surgically remove his bellybutton. When the infection came back	 the same doctor cut out his entire naval passage. I met him several years later and the saw the infection come back again. The doctor wanted to do another surgery. I urged my bf to let me try to help him instead of going under the knife again. After following my recommendations based on what I found out	 he has not had the infection since and avoided a third sugery. I'm so mad at that doctor for perfoming unneccessary surgeries on my guy!!"	1

Unfortunately	 they often harm your body in the process. There are natural supplements that do a good job of killing cancerous cells	 but don't cause harm to your body. A few supplements do have potential to be toxic to the body	 and should probably just be used in conjunction with a naturopath or alternative doctor. These include cesium	 artemisia	 and B17. In this report you will learn only about completely safe cancer supplements that can be used with no supervision.You may well ask why 	 if a safe and natural product is able to kill cancer	 doesn't your doctor recommend it. Of course	 he probably doesn't know about it	 but even if he did	 he's not likely to use it.It's the nature of the medical/drug industry.

I then went on to have the biopsy which was via Ultra sound visual system by which you could see the lumps quiet clear again.    These lumps turned out to be grade 3 Cancer	 which had infected two lympnodes.     I then had surgery after nuclear dye had been administered to keep the Doc on track when removing my breast and finding all the supposed infected areas. The surgeon took 15 lympnodes plus the sentinal gland in this operation along with the whole breast removal.    It was the ongoing treatment that had me rather bewildered as to the system of which followed.

These drug combinations shrank the tumors of nearly half the women (45%) treated. In contrast	 less than one third (29%) of those women who received chemotherapy alone had a similar response. When Herceptin was added to the chemotherapy	 it boosted survival by an average of 5 months compared to chemotherapy alone.A small number of the women taking the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin had significant heart problems	 including congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump effectively. Adriamycin was blamed for most of this effect. Herceptin on its own rarely causes heart damage. But the two drugs given together resulted in more heart damage than expected. For this reason	 the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin is no longer recommended.Navelbine chemotherapy combined with Herceptin has also been studied recently in clinical trials.----------------------------------------------Serious heart side effectsResearch News:Preliminary results from the HERA Trial: Herceptin Taken Less Frequently at Higher Doses Does Not Increase Risk of Heart Damage Less commonly	 Herceptin can damage the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.

Slightly more often (about 7% of the time)	 Herceptin causes mild heart failure.Women who experience mild or more serious heart damage can stop taking Herceptin and start taking heart-strengthening medications. This often brings heart function back to normal.While heart damage can be more severe when Herceptin is given along with other chemotherapy drugs known to cause heart damage	 including Adriamycin (chemical name: doxorubicin) and possibly other drugs like it.Taking Herceptin with the chemotherapy drug Taxol (chemical name: paclitaxel) does not increase your risk of severe heart damage. Studies have shown that this combination causes only slightly more mild heart damage than Herceptin alone. Women in clinical trials who are receiving Herceptin plus Taxol are being watched very closely for this effect.Testing your heart before and during Herceptin treatmentBefore starting Herceptin therapy	 you should have an echocardiogram or a MUGA scan to check how well your heart is functioning.An echocardiogram uses sound waves to take detailed pictures of the heart as it pumps blood.

But really	 if you feel disconcerted about any vaccines for your daughter	 do this:Sit down with your wife and research *credible* vaccine information (such as from the CDC or health sites that are not a "".com""). Decide where you'd like to go from there	 and then talk with the pediatrician *after* you've educated yourselves about the vaccines.I feel there are a few required vaccines that should not be required	 or even recommended. But I'm not going to disregard all vaccinations for my son because of a few that I feel he does not need at a young age	 if ever (such as the chickenpox vaccine--I wish I had researched that one before it was given to my son	 otherwise I'd never have had him vaccinated for chickenpox).But for things like whooping cough	 polio	 tetanus	 mumps	 measles	 rubella	 and whatever else there is out there that can maime	 hospitalize	 or kill a child	 I'd never pass up that vaccine."	0

She was NORMAL before her shots.    Her neurologist even says it is due to her vaccines.

She had language	 didn't self-stim	 didn't have autistic type behaviors	 didn't have seizures	 and she acted like a typical toddler for here age.

A mother knows her children more than ANY study or research EVER will.    I am far from being a wacko cospiracy theorist... but the average person doesn't get told much.    It's our responsibility as parents (as I am quickly learning) to NOT trust many people... trust yourself	 and God.

post_1864817	post_1784719	"heres a story for you all about vacinnes.    When my five year old was little and got her first MMR vacinne	 she broke out in about 1000 little red bumps all over her	 I mean she was covered from top of head to bottom of feet.I am personally up in the air about risks vs. benefits.    It amazes me all the risks for those stupid things though.    My brother also had a seizure due to a vacinne when he was little.You are so correct about mothers intuition.You taught me something I didn't know	 about aborted fetus cells being used to produce these vaccines.    That really makes me upset to hear.Both my girls have had the shots	 but at the same time I believe that it is a parents right to decide weather or not to get their kids vacinated.I guess I can see good sides to both.    I do know that there are a lot of really bad risks but the diseases that they help protect against are bad too.I think what the docs need to stop doing is giving so many of the shots at the same time	 because if a child has a reaction to one of them it will be harder to figure out which one it was to."	1

Newer vaccines	 made in alternative	 more ethical ways... and more truthful information on the benefits and the risks... as well as a revised schedule of ages for doses    would be a good start.    Every child is different.    I know that when I got my Hep B vacc back when I worked in a lab	 you're supposed to get 3 sets.... after 2 they 'titered' me to see how much immunity I already had.    I was good... so I didn't need the 3rd shot.    Why don't they use this same method on our kids instead of subjecting them to so much that they might not even NEED???     I	 like you	 think parents need to have more say in what their children are subjected to.    After reading many stories like yours and others	 it's so SAD for so many kids and their families... I think more parents need to let their voices be heard.    I'm going to start being a little louder too (pretty hard for a shy person like me).    It's needed... for our kids!"	1

However	 during my childhood I have seen plenty of victims of Polio of the previous generation who were crippled by the disease. That is permanent damage. And I would not wish that one upon a whole society. Polio and Smallpox vaccination to me is a must. Also	 when my son was just two weeks old	 a neighbor handed me her infant to watch for a few hours and did not tell me the little girl    had the Whooping Cough.

post_1883179	post_1784719	"Hi ladies.    I was just faced with this dilema the other day.    My DD turned one and we went in for her check up and routine blood work up for lead and aneamia	 which by they way was torturous!!	 anyway	 I asked as I always do	 what shots she would be getting that day.First off let me start first by saying that I NEVER allow her to get more than 2 at a time and thankfully I found a dr that totally agreed with that	 but I digress.    Anyway my point is and I do have one	 is that she was supposed to ger her MMR shot that day and I opted not to have her gt it.My reasons are this..it is NOT a life threatening disease so therefore why pump her with more chemicals than necessary.    I feel the same way about the chicken pox shot which sh will not be getting either.    First it wears off over time and I would rather her get them as a child than as an adult when it could be extremely dangerous.So my dr really did not give me a hard time and made me sign a waiver and said that I could change my mind.    I think vaccines are good because the mor we stop vaccinating the more these diseases have a chance of gaining ground again and we certainly don't want to be living in the middle ages.    I'm hoping this will not be an issue when she goes to school.IF thre is a connection for autism and I doubt there is but they haven't many ideas so they are creating things to divert from the fact that they just don't know	 I think it's a predisposition for some kind of a reaction.If I had known more about the shots when she was first born she would not have gotten the series of Hep B either."	1

post_1906625	post_1906510	"Your healthcare provider should do a full iron work up- hematocrit	 hemoglobin	 serum iron and iron-binding capacity and liver ferritin.

post_1936565	post_1906510	"Be very careful here.    Make certain to do a COMPLETE workup before she gives you IV iron and continue to do complete workups in between.    Prior to being diagnosed with normocytic anemia	 I used to (duck out of here now anyone who doesn't want to read about women's issues - just warning ya!) have extremely heavy periods	 for an unusually long number of days.    I was diagnosed with adnemyosis (sp?)    At any rate	 I really did have that uterine condition.    My chronic anemia was chalked up to iron definciency anemia resultant from blood loss.    Made sense to everyone	 even me.So my internist gave me about five bazillion iron shots.    Well first of all	 let me just warn you	 iron shots stain your skin brown.    They are a deep intramuscular injection	 but it doesn't matter	 they leach out into your skin.    This was about seven years ago.    It took three years for the stains	 which resembled bruises that made it seem to anyone I might be dating as though I had some sort of extreme spanking fetish	 to fade to nothing.    (Yes	 my life should be a movie).    Anyway	 it didn't bring my blood count up	 so a year later	 my internist sent me to a hematologist.    She again diagnosed me with iron deficiency anemia.    She put me on IV iron	 to save me from having any more stained thighs and also because it was a more efficient way to supply the iron.    There were several ivs taking up several afternoons during many weeks.    My crit and hemaglobin continued to fall.    They decided to do a partial hysterectomy on me given my uterine condition and in the hopes that with no blood loss my anemia would clear.    They did	 and my crit continued to fall to the point that they had to transfuse me in the hospital.    I continued to drop and they put me on procrit.    They screwed up the hysterectomy and had to open me back up and fix an intestinal block stuck to the suture site of the hysterectomy as well as remove my very hot and infected appendix	 also stuck to the suture site.The procrit relieved (and still does) my anemia.    I was having extreme diarhea(diarrhea)though	 no idea why.    They scheduled an MRI of the stomach (or catscan	 something) and found a tumor	 by chance	 in my liver (actually it was three small tumors	 but the first lab only saw one).    To rule out hepatocellular cancer	 they decided to do a biopsy.    They tried to do a lap biopsy	 but couldn't get far enough into my liver to reach the tumor.    They did however get a liver biopsy in which they found high levels of iron	 due to - you guessed it	 the hematologist who had overdosed me on iron when I didn't really have iron deficiency anemia.    Mind you	 she'd done a bone marrow sample.    In other words	 she had everything she needed to have to have been able to discern that it was not iron deficiency anemia.Now	 back to you.    I swear I related the above not for the telling of it so much as to show you why its important that you understand that these doctors treating us are really limited sometimes in their knowledge.    Even the specialists!    So to answer your question	 the reason you have to be careful about iron is that if it settles in your organs it brings on end organ damage much more quickly and necessitates organs transplants.    This is especially bad when you look at the fact that most of the people who get trasfusions on a regular basis tend to already be pretty sick (hemophiliacs and people with other chronic diseases and disorders) and are less likely to be good organ transplant candidates.This is the reason that they can't just give people who need red blood cells transfusion after transfusion.    Its the very reason they needed a drug like procrit introduced onto the market in the first place	 in order to reduce tranfusions by allowing patients to make their own red blood cells.        There were times when transfusions could not be helped in chronically ill patients	 but new medications have been innovative and have allowed a reduction of transfusions in that community.In my case	 even though I was anemic	 I chose to have my iron overdose treated at my regular doctor's office (talked them into it actually	 they didn't WANT to do it).    I had them bleed me a unit at each visit (once every week or two) and at the same time I upped my procrit (epogen) to compensate for the blood loss.    We did this in increments until all of my blood levels for the various forms of iron were down.    It worked	 and once I wasn't swimming in iron	 my mysterious severe diarrhea went away.    Due to this	 I can only assume it was related to the iron overdose since I've not had it before or since.Anyway PSP	 I'd get referred to a hematologist.    The thing that troubles me a bit is that typically in this Hep C combo treatment	 the anemia that patients experience is caused by hemolysis	 that is	 the early destruction of red blood cells.    That is the typical anemia presentation.    And it makes sense to me with what you've described	 younger blood cells that are dying suddenly.    That sounds exactly like hemolysis	 blood cells that are being destroyed early.    To me	 and I could be extremely wrong about this	 but it seems like that would show up as many baby blood cells	 because the older cells are destroyed early and the body is trying to compensate by constantly making new baby cells.    And that particular scenario has nothing to do with iron deficiency	 as born out by your bloodwork.    The thing is	 since your doctor doesn't really seem to be all that conversant with this topic	 I'd urge you getting in to see a hematologist.    Especially since there should be no problem I can see in putting you back at once a week on procrit now.    I'd ask for the referral and I'd also ust tell your doc treating for the hep c that you would really feel more comfortable with going back to once a week on the procrit now	 rather than waiting.    Tell her that you have difficulty functioning with your blood count at this level.    See what she says."	0

I didn't get immunized when pregnant	 but was not allowed to leave the hospital after delivery until I got the vaccine.Both kids are totally ""normal"" -- no autism or any other chronic problems.There is a risk if you get german measles (rubella) when pregnant -- although since almost every child is now immunized the risk is not that great that you would even be exposed to it.I think I would get it before pregnancy (make sure you're not) and ask your ob/gyn how long before you can try to get pregnant.I wouldn't worry too much about all these studies -- everything is very dramatic online and really worst-case scenarios -- if a link can even be made.Good luck!"	0

post_1922219	post_1921711	"hello... I can relate to your concerns! I was having the same ones just before my daughter was born. We had done alot of reading on the subject of vaccines	 and have decided to NOT vaccinate at all	 ever. In addition to containing thimerasol (mercury)	 the shots also contain many other harmful chemicals and toxins that will actually weaken the childs immune system	 and potentially cause many problems down the road.http://www.informedchoice.info/cocktail.htmlhere is a link that will provide the ingredient list to the different shots. if you do a search on the ingredients in there	 you will find that most of them are very toxic	 and should not be in a human's body	 especially not a small child's.I would definately reccomend really doing an indepth study on vaccines before you decide to have any more shots given. Your options are completely up to you	 not any doctor. If you choose not to have all the shots done	 there are exepmtions to have them in public school. If you decide you want to do them	 but delayed	 I would strongly reccomend delaying as long as absolutely possible to give your child's body and immunity time to strenghthen before doing so.It is a tough decision	 just make sure that you make a very informed choice!!p.s.- even if your doctor tells you the brand they use does not contain thimerasol	 ask to see the vial.

post_1924246	post_1921711	"I have a 3month old boy and have been doing lots and lots of research.    I would recommend books like the one by Dr. Stephanie Cave ""what your doctor may not tell you about vaccinations"".    She talks about each disease and each vaccine.    Also options on selective vaccination plus an alternative time frame to give them.    Another good book""Vaccinations	 A thoughtful parent's guide"" by Aviva Jill Romm.    Another good explanation of each disease	 risks and explanation of the vaccines.    For me	 it was helpful to start understanding the diseases and risks	 odds of getting it etc.    Also then to read about what is in each vaccine is an eye-opener	 to say the least.I have heard stats on autism that it is 1 in 94 for boys.    Also 1 in 150 for boy/girls	 if I understand that correctly.    I have read that as well as seen it on TV.    It is up to you to do the research and try and understand why there has been such a rise in Autism in the last 10 years.    I do know that boys are more prone to autism.    Anyway.    I liked having books on hand to read as well as looking online.    The CDC Pink Book which you can locate online is a good source (Center For Disease Control).    Explains diseases/vaccines.    Mothering.com good source for stories and options of how to spread out vaccines	 delay vaccines/selective vaccines	 etc.My son has had 2 rounds of Hep B (which I regret) and I am not going further with anymore.    If I do	 I will selective vaccinate	 perhaps Hib at 7 or 12 months.    I will NOT do MMR	 that is for sure	 and I dought DTaP.    I'm nervous about wooping cough	 but the research on aPertussis vaccine is scary.    And most of these vaccines have been ""remodeled"" since 2000 to take out mercury	 so I also feel my kid is a guinea pig to see what will happen 10 to 20 years from now.    Look how long it took for them to see that oral polio vaccine was giving people polio?    And finally changed it in 2000.    And similar situation with DTP being changed to DTaP because of the adverse reactions.Again	 I liked Mothering.com and looked into vaccine site to just get a feel for what other people were doing.    But	 most importantly it is each parent's responsibility to research fully and then make an informed decision and not just decided off the cuff to go one way or the other.    Vaccines have done a good thing	 but as they say ""one size may not fit all"". Hope any of this helps.    Do research!!"	1

post_1925656	post_1921043	"My natropath had told before that estrogen is prevalent in shampoo	 soaps	 skin care lotions...every where we would least expect it. Scary	 isn't it? I really believe my cancer was triggered when I went back on the pill after having my son. It was then	 that I can really look back and notice that my symptoms gradually started. I will be seeing my natropath next week	 and will be asking her about this again. I have a feeling I need to be much more aware about the products that I use on a day to day basis. It amazes me though	 that more isn't mentioned about this is the media. I think if women knew	 it would really open our eyes.

post_1925899	post_1921043	"Hi	 yes it is amazing how many chemicals and things can be put into products without our even knowing it.    Its very scary.    Parabens are one of the biggies.    These are added to lotions	 face care products	 shower gels	 face makeup	 and lord knows what else.    From what I have seen there are several kinds of parabens	 They start out with a different prefix	 such as methelparaben	 etc. but always end with paraben.    You can look for them in the list of ingredients on the back of products.    Since I have learned about this	 I have been reading the labels on my products	 and almost ALL of them have it.    Kimchi	    I am no expert	 am still learning myself.    Please google in these two words and much info will come up. (paraben estrogen)    I don't know what kind of access you have since you two live in other countires	 but I will give you a list of what I have found so far.    Burts bees (makes lotioin	 hair products	 makeup	 and almost everything) their stuff is all natural and paraben free.    Toms of maine makes good stuff but it is kind of plain for my tastes and the deoderant doesnt work.    A good deoderant is    Sure unscented solid.     There is a product I like called Carol's daughter	 they have lotion	 and body gels and scrubs that I like because they have the same scent in a set.    I just found another product at Sephora    called lavanilla	    it has a natural perfume	 and lotion which actually contain NO parabens and have antioxidents.    It's kind of exspensive though.    I bought it for my daughter and she loves it though.    I emailed Origins and they said    all thier products are paraben free starting this year.     There are tons of other natural products out there too.    I never knew so many existed until I started looking.     An easy way to find things is to look for ""organic""    Most of it is natural without parabens	 but always look at the ingredients in everything just to make sure cause some companies claim to be organic and natural but are full of parabens.    It's not hard to find good stuff if you look.        Good luck guys	 do some reading and looking at labels and you will be surprised at what you find!    If you guys have trouble finding stuff in your countries	 let me know and maybe I can get them for you and send them.    Shannon"	1
post_1934082	post_1921043	"Thanks for the info...yes	 can't find any of those products here but I do have people buy stuff in States for me			I stopped using Sure unscented and switched to Tom's of Maine's deodorant after reading about aluminum in deodorant products may cause breast cancer.

I was on 6 rounds of taxol/carbo. which ended Aug 2.    My doctor prescribed Femara for 5 years.    I was on it for 2 or 3 weeks. The side effects were debilitating I could barely walk due to bone/joint pain especially in my lower back.    She switched me to Arimidex. I've been on that 3-4 weeks and have the same side effects only not as severe.    She also put me Celebrex to relieve the pain.    She said she would only keep me on it for only a little while.    That seems to be helping.    I was concerned about taking the Celebrex because of heart trouble associated with arthritis drugs.    The pharmacist told me that Celebrex was not recalled as other drugs have been.    I decided I would rather fight the cancer at this point in time.

She was not rolling over or even strong enough to sit up.    She was also still sleeping like a newborn baby.    When we asked her ped. he just told me that    some babies simply just require more sleep than othres.    Needless to say	 we got a new doctor.    He started us out by getting an eye exam done on her and it turns out she needed glasses (I tell ya	it was the cutest thing to see a 6 month old with glasses)	    Unfortunately	 that did not solve our problems.    She ended up being diagnosed with CP at the age of 1 and a seizure disorder at the age of 3.    There was no doubt in my mind that my daughter was Autistic also.    The doctors did not want to ""label"" her with it	 but it was so obvious.    Then at the age of 8	 the doctor did an Autistic screen (it was questions her dad and I had to answer and then depending on how many fit in the Autistic catagory told weateh she had it or not).    She is 9 now and is just starting to walk and is still non-verbal.    We were also assured that her immunizations had nothing to do with her Autisum.    If I had to do it all over again	 I would still get the shots.    I simply think she is a gift from God	 and he has great things planned for her.

Embarrasing to have the neighbors tell me the next day. That was years ago...Currently	 I keep a bottle of Melatonin 3mg +B6 for occasional insomnia. Works like a charm and I only have to use it a couple times a month when I have an early shift (4am) and have to go to sleep early. Melatonin regulates the neurotransmitters - seratonin	 norepinephrine	 and dopamine. You may need a higher dose but don't go over 6mg. It can be purchased in 1mg or 3mg tabs with or without B6. Cheap too... You can get it at any supplement store or most drug stores on the vitamin aisle. You could probably start with 6mg just before bed for a few days	 then taper off down to 3mg or lower	 eventually just using them when needed. Another alternative is L-Tryptophan - The ""turkey"" amino acid. This is a little more difficult to find in drugstores	 but supp stores have it - or you can go to Nutritionexpress.com or ProSource.net online and order either Melatonin or Tryptophan. The Tryptophan is more expensive but works as well as Melatonin. You could even combine a lower dose of both...Google ""L-Tryptophan"" and ""melatonin"" for more info and good luck to you!Will"	1

post_2032368	post_2028940	"That's the standard procedure.    I was 36 when diagnosed (during my pregnancy) with stage 3 cancer	 ER+	 HER2-	 1 sentinel node positive	 13 negative.I did 4 rounds Adriamycin/Cytoxin with a 3 week spread	 then had to wait to have my baby and started Abraxane (the newer taxane drug because I was allergic to Taxol) with the same regimin 10 days after my C-section.    Lost my hair both times	 but no other bad effects although I did have some minor changes in my 2D echo of my heart and sometimes have residual tingling in my extremities (from the taxanes).    Radiation for 37 treatments after chemo was pretty easy.    And I just finished my reconstruction this past summer.I know you'll do Herceptin where I'm doing Tamoxifin(tamoxifen).    ER+ gets 5 years Tamoxifin(tamoxifen).    HER2+ gets Herceptin	 but I don't know any details on that drug.There are some alternative healers that can give you some vitamins that are supposed to help with cancer recurrence.    I tried that for a bit after all the chemo/radiation was over.    Can't say that they helped other than to relieve me of some money.    The doc promised a lot	 but I never thought she came through with anything she said.    It was probably more her than anything.    But it left me not so trusting.You'll have to do your own thinking on that and do a lot of research.    You can start by a google on Alternative Medicine + Breast Cancer.    I would go forth with the chemo and radiation since they are proven to ensure any little cancer cells are killed.    Hair loss is temporary.    Ask for Zofran if the nausea beats on you.    Drink lots of water and walk as much as you can.    It's not so bad looking from the other end of it.    It's scary where you are right now.Best of luck to you	 however you decide to go!"	0

Unfortunately	 they often harm your body in the process. There are natural supplements that do a good job of killing cancerous cells	 but don't cause harm to your body. A few supplements do have potential to be toxic to the body	 and should probably just be used in conjunction with a naturopath or alternative doctor. These include cesium	 artemisia	 and B17. In this report you will learn only about completely safe cancer supplements that can be used with no supervision.You may well ask why 	 if a safe and natural product is able to kill cancer	 doesn't your doctor recommend it. Of course	 he probably doesn't know about it	 but even if he did	 he's not likely to use it.It's the nature of the medical/drug industry. Doctors use and recommend drugs that are approved in a process that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The drug companies only make drugs that can be patented. That way they can sell them for huge mark-ups and have no competition.Lady00712/10/07ALL    Did you know that CAT SCANS are equivalent to 400 chest xrays in Radiation.Did you know that TAXOL kills veins and cripples the area where its been administered....Did you know that HERCEPTIN 2 gives your cardiotoxidity...weakens your HEART...TAXOL combined with HER2 Govt approved only if you take HER2 WITH TAXOL...wow    That sounds like blackmail..Their aim is to kill you one way or the other.Lady00712/10/07ALL    After feeling three lumps in my left breast last december 2006.    They did a mamogram(mammogram)on the breast and you could see the lumps quiet clear.    I then went on to have the biopsy which was via Ultra sound visual system by which you could see the lumps quiet clear again.    These lumps turned out to be grade 3 Cancer	 which had infected two lympnodes.     I then had surgery after nuclear dye had been administered to keep the Doc on track when removing my breast and finding all the supposed infected areas. The surgeon took 15 lympnodes plus the sentinal gland in this operation along with the whole breast removal.    It was the ongoing treatment that had me rather bewildered as to the system of which followed.    I was hit with AC x 4 Cyclophosphamide	 Amend	 Granistron	 Hydrochlorid	 and    Dexamethasone [sent my sugar levels sky high spent week in hospital with that] with maxalon to stabalize my system and diabetic 2 medications.    This was only in the first 4 treatments at 3 week intervals.    Then HER2 combined with TAXOL another 4 treatments...Now I am down onto HER2 on its own...My heart rate first up was 38% next 42% next 47% the next test is pending.    I have decided that if the heart does not come up over 50% next test that my treatment should be stopped.    I need an opinion here?Lady00712/10/07ALL    To my way of thinking my breast should have been hit with radiation to shrink the cancer berfore surgery was administered.    Thus giving a more direct approach to the cancer via the surgeon.    Then when the wound was healed I should have been hit again with radiation.

Because	 keep on posting during this time so we can give you support. With me	 I used no deodorant at all during this time	 at least not under the affected arm. And	 for some reason	 I really also did not need any deodorant. I never smelled at all during radiation.At least be sure not to have anything on you for a few hours prior to radiation. It will be OK	 and it does not hurt. (Except	 for the very end	 the burns may become pretty bad and you may need painkillers then	 but it will all heal before you know it.)The only discomfort or pain I had was when it came to having to put my arms back. It really hurt in the right arm	 but except for that first session where they do all the measurements	 the radiation sessions only take a few minutes.

Swampy will mention at the outset that this is a hot research topic	 and there are many good arguments to be made.The chemical in question is BPA	 a chemical that is used in the manufacture of hard plastics. This chemical can leach out and contaminate the contents of the container. The amount of contamination depends on the temperature of the contents	 so a baby bottle with heated contents will be more contaminated than cold water.According to the CDC	 93% of all Americans have detectable levels of BPA in their urine. BPA is excreted shortly after being consumed	 so this shows a widespread	 continuous exposure.According to the EFSA recommendations	 BPA intake should be safe at 0.05 mg / kg body weight. A study from the Netherlands testing polycarbonate baby bottles concludes that the contamination of water heated to boiling is from 1.4 to 35 mg / kg	 and that the contamination does not go down with repeated use.Studies on pregnant animals show that a high level of BPA exposure has health effects. The CDC's fact sheet says ""hormone like effects on the developing reproductive system and neurobehavioral changes in the offspring.""The FDA conducted their own studies	 using the same standards that would have been applied to a new product. Their tests concluded that a person who used canned formula	 where BPA leaches in from the can liner	 and a polycarbonate baby bottle	 results in an intake that is under 7 micrograms per day	 which	 according to them	 should be a safe level of exposure.To reiterate:1. BPA is found in can liners	 in dental work	 and in polycarbonate plastics.2. BPA is alleged to affect the developing fetus.3. The low dose long term exposure of humans to BPA is not known."	0

post_5066572	post_5065704	"Hello there	First of all you can start by physical activity and healthy diet. There is a special kind of diet that will promote serotonin production.Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.    Thus to produce serotonin	 you need tryptophan.    Tryptophan is an amino acid that you can only obtain by consumption.    Therefore you want to consider eating foods containing sufficient levels of tryptophan to help replenish your serotonin levels each day.    The following is a list:1. Cottage cheese.2. Brown rice.3. Avocados.4. Bananas.5. Walnuts.6. Tomatoes.7. Soy protein.8. Meat.9. Turkey is probably the highest serotonin containing food.    Eat turkey to help increase serotonin levels.Also try Melatonin	 it is a natural hormone produced in the pineal gland	 which is outside of the blood-brain barrier	 acts as an endocrine hormone since it is released into the blood. It helps with sleep and better sleep cycle and i recommend it even more if you withdraw from an anti-depressant. You can try doing some internet research on it it have many advantages.Good luck on the withdrawalM4"	1

post_2649366	post_2648985	"I know in theory that sounds logical	 but it doesn't work like that.It is the reuptake of Serotonin in the brain that can cause depression	 not the actual level or amount in the brain.For example you could have perfectly normal levels of Serotonin in your brain	 but if the receptors in your brain are performing the reuptake (a kind of absorbsion) of that Serotonin too rapidly then much less Serotonin is left in between the receptors and this inhibits the brains ability to function normally	 which can result in a depressed brain.Not to mention that Serotonin reuptake is not the only contributing factor related to depression. many other neurotransmitting chemicles also play a big part in brain function. Sush as Neurephineferine	 Doapamine	 and Triptafane	 just to name a few.It's important to remember that SSRI drugs such as Prozac	 Zoloft	 Paxil	 Lexapro	 Ect.... Do not raise the level of Serotonin in the brain. Rather they work by Inhibiting the reuptake of Serotonin that already exists in the brain	 Thus resulting in a slightly higher build up of Serotonin to remain in stasis between the billions of receptors in the brain. this inhabition of reuptake allows for improved brain fuctioning as it relates to mood and well being because more Serotonin is left in stasis between the receptors of the brain that rely on this presense of Serotonin to properly fire. Think of it like a tiny bit of fuel in between two slightly spaced apart receptors. The receptors need this Serotonin as a kind of bridge to fire data back and forth. When the Serotonin is artifically (with meds) prevented from being absorbed by the brain	 more of it can stay in the little places between the receptors to do what it does best	 act as a bridge for firing data to different parts of the brain.To take any drug that is designed to increase the amount of Serotonin in the brain is very dangerous. These drugs do exist. For example the drug Ecstacy does this very well.The problem with taking a drug that directly pumps Extra Serotonin into the brain is that eventually your body will do what it does best..... It will stop naturally producing Serotonin because it is getting it artifically. For this to happen would be a nightmare scenario and could result in eventual brain damage.There have been some huge advances toward a working test that can give doctors a better idea of which antidepressant will work best for each individual. This would take a lot of the guess work out of finding the right AD medication for your individual biology.It's still the the testing phases	 but I realy think we will see this test approved by the FDA in the next few years. The accuracy of the test is whats going to be the big determining factor in it's success."	0
post_2652600	post_2648985	"Well if the amount of serotonin in your brain is already low why would a drug that helps reuptake like SSRI's make much of a difference? Could this be why people get rebound effects or suddenly a med will stop working because the brain adjusts to the extra serotonin in the brain unable to be absorbed and stops producing enough to even fill those gaps. Much like Alzheimer's patients who take L-dopa ""synthetic dopamine"" they keep having to up the dose because the body will adapt over time. Maybe if you could trick the brain into keep releasing the current amount of serotonin and take synthetic serotonin maybe that could prevent the rebound cycle."	1
post_2653604	post_2648985	"SSRI's don't help reuptake of Serotonin	 they do just the opposite	 they inhibit the reuptake of Serotonin. It's this inhibition effect that slowes the reuptake process	 which in turn allows for higher levels of Serotonin to build up in the brain.It's kind of like finding a back door to raising Serotonin levels without introducing a chemical to the system that directly forces a flood of serotonin to be produced artifically.Scientists could easily make a drug that simply and directly raises levels of Serotonin in the brain. The problem with that approach is that to do so would have very serious long term effects on proper brain function.For example	 if I were to inject you with an artifical hormone that your body already produces naturally and I did this for several months	 the end result would be that your body would say	 ""well	 I'm getting plenty so I can shut down making anymore.""Then if the injections were stopped	 there is a good chance your body may not start producing that hormone again. At least not in sufficient levels to keep you well.The same thing could happen if pure Serotonin were taken. The results could be devistating.This action is much different than our bodies ability to build resistance to drugs and alcohol. SSRI meds and other AD medications often poop out in time.This is why you see so many people having to change meds that once worked well for them.Our bodies are amazing machines and they are very good at learning how to destroy any Chemicle or drug that is not native to it. Some peoples bodys do this very fast and others are slower at it. My body happens to be very good at building resistance to any medication I put in it. I get maybe 1 year on any one AD medication before my body renders it usless."	0

post_3443621	post_2648985	"Buspar or ""buspirone hydrochloride."" is an anti-anxiety agent. It's not a Benzodiazaphine like Xanax or Valum.

About 60% of people that suffer from Anxiety dissorder also suffer from Major cronic(chronic)depression. About 85% of people that suffer from Severe Depression also suffer from Anxiety dissorder.So now you see how common it is for the two dissorders to play together.Depression and anxiety are like two little peas in a pod. They both need each other to survive. Alone they are less powerful and they know this very well. That's not to say that both don't need to be treated.You may not have been properly disagnosed	 and as such you may not be getting the proper medication which can = trouble for you and your condition.Not sure if your doctor is an expert in Mental health	 but if he isn't may I suggest you find a Psychiatrist ASAP so that you can get proplerly treated and feel better.Please refer to the post I just made on the boards about Regular doctors & Psychiatrists.

There is still a lot of studies being conducted to better help diagnose if these factors may contribute to why people like us are so medication resistant. We may just be getting the wrong meds.This new P-doc currently has me on Lamictal	 Pristiq	 and Lithium.He also explained that for me to get relief we may have to go as high as 600Mgs a day on the lithium and up to 250Mgs a day on the Lamictal. Accoring to him he explained that just 150Mgs a day of Lamictal is the lowest amount possible to effect change and 300Mgs of Lithium is the lowest amout to effect change.So these dosages are not as shocking high as many may think.As for Lithium	 it is a very old drug	 but do not underestimate it's amazing ability to add more punch to the antidepressant your already taking.Lithium is also one of the only drugs proven to reduce suicidal thoughts.Down side of Lithium is that you have to drink lots of fluids becuase it will make you sweat like a pig and you also have to get your blood lithium levels checked every 6 months to ensure your Kidneys are dealing with the drug ok.I think your on the right track with adding Lamictal to your antidepressant	 but if your depression is still not being fully kicked	 then you may want to try also adding Lithium."	0

It's also nearly impossible to treat and I must take massive amounts of medication to produce theraputic response.Then you have Moderate depression.

post_4736981	post_2648985	"I also agree it's not entirely the amount of serotonin that effects mental illness. In fact we do not know all the actions of SSRIs. We do know this. tryptophan (amino acid) converts to 5-Hydroxytryptophan (amino acid) which converts to serotonin. Whats this mean? I know there has been a study of people with Celiac Disease and mental illness. With Celiac Disease you cant absorb vital nutrients or very little. Without basic vitamins minerals you can't assimilate amino acids which are vital for brain function.This has an effect of not only serotonin but also other mood altering compounds as well.Some people have said taking 5-HTP alone will help with depression and or anxiety. It sounds good in theory but if you don't have other vitamins and other organic compounds you won't be able to metabolize it into serotonin. You could make things worse by have 5-HTP compete for room    cross over the blood brain barrier. You could block other amino acids and compounds from from crossing the bridge that are just as important for anxiety and depression.In fact if you are low in those amino acids from nutrition and or autoimmune or a bad gene	 than synthetic drugs will only work with the little amount of serotonin you have...Its like fighting a fire with a small bucket of water	and refilling the bucket with the water you just used.

post_5718225	post_2648985	"Hi	 I came across this thread researching Serotonin levels and how to measure them and how to raise them.    I have very low levels as per a blood test.    The serum blood test is	 I believe	 as mentioned	 measured indirectly.    The doctors and psychiatrists I've spoken with don't seem to have any answers to any of my questions	 but it doesn't surprise me.    They usually aren't the best at pharmacological issues.Serotonin is found in the pineal gland	 the lining of the GI tract	 the platelets	 and the brain.    It cannot cross the blood-brain barrier as serotonin - only as its precursor tryptophan.    Raising levels of tryptophan isn't a very straight forward	 simple process either.    After all my research up til now	 I think going the ""natural way"" is probably the best.    I don't mean not taking meds at all - I take many - due to having multiple medical conditions.    I have MS	 Systemic Sclerosis	 Interstitial Cystitis	 Osteoporosis	 Hypothyroid	 Lung problems	 Gastroparesis	 Scleroderma Esophagus	 and on and on.    Doctors don't know what to do at this point to help me.The things I've read so far - to raise serotonin levels - are 1. Getting sunlight - especially morning sun	 2. exercise	 3. diet rich in complex carbs and protein - salmon	 turkey	 walnuts	 etc. (you can find lists) 4. meditation - prayer - whatever you can do to think about positive pleasant thoughts.    Serotonin greatly effects our sleep cycle	 which of course greatly effects mood.I had planned to try 5-HTP until I discovered all the possible repercussions.    I've learned the hard way that meds cause many many side effects	 and as much as we at times need them - they can create havoc.

post_5968781	post_2648985	"L-Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and the precursor to serotonin. In North America you should take L-Tryptophan rather than 5-HTP to avoid high and potentially dangerous levels of serotonin in the blood (all to do with passage through the blood brain barrier).There are many pathways in the metabolism of L-Tryptophan	 and each step in a pathway is controlled by an enzyme. These enzymes are the product of your individual genetic expression and can vary greatly from one person to another. Unlike digestive enzymes	 though	 you cannot simply take cellular enzymes in a capsule. Furthermore	 cellular enzymes cannot work alone. Enzymes are as useless as a car without wheels if they lack critical coenzymes and cofactors that make them run. Coenzymes typically are the enzymatic-forms of vitamins	 such as pyridoxal 5-phosphate (the true form of vitamin B6)	 but sometimes coenzymes are biochemicals few people have even heard of.

post_7064157	post_2648985	Hi I once spoke to the wife of a psychiatrist when I was ill coming off effexor. She told me that erewhen they treat depression they do not know which part of the brain is depressed and what tablets will work it is all just a stab in the dark. In other words it is quite scary because these professionals or so called do not know what they are doing really yet they are giving out chemical altering drugs like smarties. These tablets are highly addictiveand are not easy to get off. So my question is if we went for talking therapy and got it all out of our system would we need these drugs. Also in the long run they make you more depressed and anxious than you already were. They are obviously not working !!!!I remeber being so anxious when i was on venlafluxine i am not saying its a walk in the park but i am not in bed all day and i don't lie in bed worrying.LoveLorraine xx	1

You're just regurgitating your version of what one practitioner has told you. 5-HTP has been proven at least as effective as prescription anti-depressants. I experienced no effects from Prozac or Zoloft	 and spectacular relief within weeks of beginning to take L-glutamine and L-phenylalanine.Tibia Is the first time I've heard it suggested that depression can exist in spite of normal neurotransmitter levels.

post_3006197	post_12358	"Hi	Water urticaria	 also known as aquagenic urticaria and aquagenous urticaria	 is an extremely rare form of physical urticaria. It is sometimes described as an allergy. In affected persons	 water on the skin causes hives to appear within 15 minutes and last for up to two hours.Water contact can cause aquagenic urticaria	 presumably due to chlorine or some other trace chemical in the water	 although distilled water has been known to cause this reaction.The reaction can usually be controlled with epinephrine	 antihistamines	 or cortisone-like drugs.

I have a condition that is just as controversial as Gulf War Syndrome	 so I can certainly appreciate where yankeybeans is coming from.I wonder how much of this water allergy is related to the same issues that people with chemical sensitivities face because of the modern age we're living in?    I'm certain there are other factors in the environment besides what is in tap water that is contributing to this problem.    Especially	 since it seems to be such a modern day allergy problem.    There are so many chemicals in tap water that it seems unreal.    But	 that's not the only source of exposure to so many man made chemicals in our environment.    I'm not arguing about the reasons behind this or the intentions	 because I get that	 so I don't need any comments about how all the chemicals in tap water are made to be safe drinking water	 etcetera.    I know about that.    But	 I'm sure there is more to this water allergy than what meets the eye."	0
post_3823976	post_12358	"Not diagnosed	 but I'm pretty sure I'm allergic to water	 as well. My face gets so red/blotchy after showers	 I get hives down my arms	 itchy on my neck and chest. One time after a shower	 my legs and feet were itching so bad from the knees down that I wanted to cry. Although I know it always happens when I get out of the shower	 I've never thought I was allergic to water	 lol. My manager at work actually mentioned it to me when I was talking about my neck being so red one day. She said she had a friend who was allergic to water. So 10 ten minutes ago when I got out of the shower	 all red and itchy	 I decided to look it up	 and sure enough	 there are others suffering the same thing!I've also had pityriasis rosea twice in the past several years	 and started wondering if there could be any connection. When I mentioned the water allergy to my dad	 he said it could be from the Agent Orange that was sprayed when he was in Vietnam. When I had the pityriasis	 I looked up information online to see if there was any link between the two	 and I found one such case of a man explaining it to the VA.Guess I'll just have to mention this to my doctor when I see him again!"	0

post_3827971	post_12358	"I have just read all your comments and I sympathize with all of you.I suffer much the same as you and have been for over 50 years ( I am now over 70 ) I started with an allergy	 symptoms of which were swollen eyes	tongue	 lips and face and anaphalaxis as well as hives.I saw many doctors and specialists and had scratch tests on my arm (12) but was allergic to all so they did a bigger test of 80 on my back. I was allergic to 60. So I went off all dairy products	 red wine etc and quite by chance after 12 years found I was allergic to aspirin. After I stopped all aspirin I improved dramatically except I found I could no longer go swimming	 salt water or fresh as I broke out in giant hives and you are right these rashes and hives do itch and make life miserable. I am OK if I bathe in tepid water.Cold water will make me swell up.I find that things I could not eat before I can now	( dairy etc )    but I become allergic to different foods and drugs.My research shows that one drug and one food together or two foods together can cause a reaction	 so its not an easy road .I need to keep my skin cool and dry	 I dont do any heavy exercise	I dont get stressed	 I only eat fresh food ( no packets ) I dont eat nuts	 I dont eat junk food and I limit alcohol to half a glass.

I thought I had finally diagnosed my water allergy with aquagenic pruritus	 but then I realized a rash or hives are not a symptom for them.    However	 the persistent itching after water exposure is so I think that many of their ideas may be of help.    Yahoo has an extensive Group with that name.     Short	 medical UVB treatment is high on their treatment recs	 which with my pale skin the one time that my rash seemed to go away was when I lived in Bali for 5 weeks and I let my skin get tan.    I'm not quite willing to try it with the cancer risk.    All the information that is out there now has motivated me to at least explore trying to get rid or reduce this condition.    Another high rated	 simple treatment they had was making the last minute of your shower very hot	 although my water does not get too hot so I've not had success testing that one yet.    One thread I saw also suggested a link to food allergies	 it seems so unlikely	 but since I seem to have other food sensitivities I am scheduled to see an allergist next week.

If I do not scratch	 they disappear in 15-30 minutes.    I always thought I was allergic to chlorine because in a pool the rashes are more severe.    I have fair skin and it is generally sensitive to harsh soaps and detergents.I do not use any topical creams or oral medications.    I do use a WATER FILTER and it greatly helps	 although it is not perfect.    However	 when I go to the swimming pool I do use a topical cream	 like Cortisone.I've never been to the doctor	 and unless I get health care	 I never will.    I feel like I have a good grasp on the condition/problem and my best bit of advice for everyone is to get a water filter.    I'm not sure if it would work for everyone	 but it couldn't hurt.

post_4675165	post_12358	"I am 44 years old and suffered from this on and off over the years	 some times it's really bad other times nothing. One thing I have noticed is water temp' - if luke warm or cooler it makes the itching worse. If I go out of Birmingham (UK) -usually Somerset	 I get minimal or no symptoms here or elsewhere	 there must be something in the water - I know there's Fluoride in the Birmingham water along with Chlorine so maybe this is factor. I also surf regularly and sea water has minimal effect. Swimming at the the local baths can make me itch but far less than home showering	 so maybe the fact that excercise can calm it - by the way	 I only itch after I have dried myself - usually about 5-10 min's after doing so when ever or where ever affected. Antihistamine can help an hour BEFORE showering or massaging the area rather than scratching - I get it all over my body. Try tricking your itching by getting in and out of the shower for different periods and / or different temperatures. May be there's a food link depending on what's been eaten before showering	 or state of mind /stress	 who knows	 so may variables??? Good luck to you all!"	0

post_4835640	post_12358	"I'm 34 and I've had Aguagenic pruritus since I was a child and was most recently diagnosed with aguagenic Urtcaria too. Most of the doctors I saw during my childhood thought my ""allergy"" was all in my head because there were no visible symptoms other then the welts from my scratching. They thought I was making myself sick because I believed in my ""supposed allergy"" so much. After years of suffering alone and in silence	 a doctor finally gave my allergy a name when I was 16	 aguagenic pruritus and recommend treatments including applying baby-oil after shower. Along the way	 they've recommnended various lotions and treatments but those lose their effect couple months into it and some just don't work at all. So through trial and error	 I learnt to deal with the AgP(Aguagenic Pruritus) my way. 5 years ago	 I was diagnosed with Aguagenic Urticaria when after sweat and water exposure I not only feel the pain and itchiness as usual but i also get hives all over my torso	 face	 limps	 and scalp	    and the inside of my nose starts iching and my eyelids swell up. I've learnt not to expose my skin to cold temperature right after workout	 hot shower/bath and after I swim. I still break out from my sweat and water but cold temperature aggrevates and makes the hives and itch worse. If I'm already sweating I avoid cold areas. I take lukewarm showers after a workout or swims and adjust the water temp slowly toward cool. I try to avoid the rain when possible but since I live on kauai	 the rainiest island in Hawaii	 it is unavoidable. the beach is a weekend ritual for me and my kids but i break out after a swim so I have gallons of distilled water in my car at all times. It is the only water my body will not have a violent hive reaction to eventhough the burning and itching still presist. If I take hot showers	 I make sure to avoid stepping out of the bathroom till my skin is completely dry and my hair is either completely wrapped in a towel or dried. I also apply baby oil right after a shower. My clothes are washed using Draft and I avoid fabric softner and dryer sheets. Soap is still a battle of the will	 I find a soap I like and will myself to deal with the consiquences. lol	 not practical but i've never been very practical. So there	 my life with both Aquagenic Pruritus and Urticaria. Fun stuff!!And if all that wasn't fun	 Kauai's weather is humid all year round."	0

post_4998730	post_12358	"I'm beginning to wonder if my 4 year old son has this. I've been struggling to find out why he has been breaking out in hives for the past 6 weeks -- it usually happens nearly every evening at bathtime	 when he gets into the tub	 and lasts for a while afteward. I have been giving him Zyrtec that's made especially for hives. The hives disappear overnight while he sleeps. He doesn't get them during the day while at preschool. At first I thought maybe he had a virus and that's what was causing the hives	 but it has been 6 weeks or more now	 and they still continue to pop up nearly every night. The hives are on his torso and thighs	 and sometimes on his arms -- never on his face. The hives on his thighs are often very large (almost looks like ringworm) and he even gets huge ones on his buttocks. He says they itch a little bit	 but he doesn't complain much. I have not changed laundry detergent	 soap	 or anything of that nature (he has always had ""sensitive"" skin anyway and has had respiratory issues in the past) and he isn't allergic to any foods (I've been paying close attention to what he eats). He actually underwent allergy testing when he was almost 3 because of his respiratory issues and because he used to itch his face and eyes all the time and get hives/welts	 and I was told he has no allergies (which I don't believe). Also	 we were at the beach in August and	 when he got into the salt water	 he got little red spots on him. He complained that the water ""stung."" However	 he swam in the chlorinated pool without any problem. So I'm not sure what to make of this. Any ideas/comments? I don't know whether to call the pediatrician or not. What's the point	 if not much can be done other than what I'm already doing (giving him Zyrtec)."	0

post_5275628	post_12358	"I am 43 years old. When I was in my early 20's I went to the doctors to get a diagnosis of why I break out in hives from ANY form of moisture (lotions	 oils	 sweat	 and any type of water... even if it is totally free of any minerals or additives).The doctor I saw seemed to have never witnessed such a thing before - he theorized that I had ""alot of extra histamine in my body and I release it through my pores whenever moisture touches my skin."" His prescription was to take an anti-histamine and four showers a day.. by the end of the day I should have ""spent"" all my reserved histamine.I never tested it.. I can't imagine anyone having time for 4 showers a day... so I have just suffered it.I think it started with puberty. One of my sons (I have two) also developed the same condition at around 12-14 years old.I will be going through menopause (surgically) soon	 so I will be interested to see if ""the change"" fixes the condition	 since it seems related to hormones - I'll let you know."	0
post_5278218	post_12358	i have this aswel or so i thinkalthough maybe not as bad as othersit started when i was 13 and now 3 years on i occasionally get it.what i dont understand is why i get it because seem to blame it on impurities of some kind in the water but my reaction is worst in the sea. i do get these spots in my shower at home but it tends to vary from shower to to shower and pool to pool as sometimes in hotels i dont get it at all or sometimes i do. If anyone has anything they could reccomend that would be great? or even any information?ThanksPs. I believe this is much more common than publicised	0

post_5467174	post_12358	"I am amazed and pleased with how many people are talking about water-related urticaria since only two years ago!    By searching and speaking out	 you are creating the fist steps to    the firstI researched the topic about 2.5 years ago when our then 17 year old daughter first had a reaction that resulted in anaphylactic shock.    She's been in the water on the same beach in Maryland	USA her entire life. She had been sitting in the sun (became heated) and walked into the water (possibly much cooler) and came out 5 minutes later with with arms	 torso	and legs covered with obvious hives and rash.    We walked her to the condo and she began to have trouble breathing	 became weak and fainted before we could lay her all the way down on the floor.    She recovered within an hour but her hives lasted 3-5 days.    We thought there were a few different possibile causes	 but could not be sure.    Ever since that time	 if she walks into the water and walks right back out	 she comes out with hives and rash	 instantly.     Fortunately her only reaction is ocean water.I was searching for newer information tonight in preparation for an appointment with an allergist.    I was so pleased to find this forum as there were only about 4 finds during my search 2.5 years ago.    There are several references to saltwater in this forum as being a worse reaction than other water sources. So	 my daughter's reaction may be the start of things to come or an intensified form?.     I'd love to hear from others with this manifestation."	0

It is an isocannic added to everything	 soap toothpaste	 feminine products	 paints makeup	 the list is (insanely huge). The reason i ask is prior to my wifes reaction she had a horrible reaction to hair dye	 (putting her in the hospital) the reaction had begun quite mildly and grown each time since her early 20's. This last reaction damned near killed her. then 3 to 4 months ago she began getting a red itchy blotch on her arm ..it grew and grew untill recently the minute water hits her she breaks out into a full red itchy blotch.    We began by removing all drugs	 removed all of her makeup	 soap and the such and found PPG 1 thru 7000 was in every bloody product we looked at. Replaced the products still has the reaction.....doctor and dermatologist say enhhh reaction is just nerves and touchy skin. so in the past week we tried a nice bath in Tea water (tannic acid) tempid temp.. and it dissappeared for 4 days	 she took a shower today and its back with a vengance.

post_5542236	post_12358	"Hello	 my name is Anna and I am 22yrs old. I live in Montana	 U.S.A.I was diagnosed with Aquagenetic Urticaria about two months ago. I never thought anyone could be allergic to water. People ask me all the time	 ""how can you be allergic to something that makes up 75% of your body?""I have come up with some clever come backs for the outside world that doesnt believe an individual could be allergic to water. I will pass them on to those who need a clever come back.1) I mix my own hydrogen and oxygen2) I am H20 intollerant- I took that from Nemo	 the movie.3) I drink powdered water4) I can consume dehyrodrated water5) I'm not sun burnt	 I'm just allergic to water!Although I have turned this into a big joke with all my friends	 I recently realized I won't be able to snowboard which is the best thing to do in the winter when you live in Montana. I can't move to California or Florida because of the heat and humitity. Seattle....went there to visit for a weekend with no rain coat! Delivering Pizzas in the rain and being allergic to water *****!I have been medicated	 with a generic version of Zrytec and when I have a reaction I take another pill called Hyroxyzine. I didnt see that mentioned in the other posts but I did see a doctor rescently and he had another name for it. I went to this doctor because I felt a tighting of my throat while visiting Seattle	 Washington. The doctor believed it had nothing to do with my allergy	 which was a relief. Although my condition is external as of now	 if I had not gone and gotten a second opinion when I initially went to find out what was making me break out	 the condition could have lead to my throat swelling up. I do carry an Epi pen with me at all times. This adrenalin rush injection is supposed to save my life if the reaction becomes life threatening. the only problem I am deathly afraid of needles	 and now I carry one wherever I go.I first noticed my reation this last summer floating the Clark Fork river. I became red and shakey(shaky). Now that I think back on it I used to get a reaction when I got out of the shower in Middle school and High school. This reaction was occasional and usually only consumed my legs. This first apperance	 although noticable	 never lasted more than 10 minutes after a shower so I assumed it was the heat or water pressure. Only now	 6 years later	 has the reaction is full blown. Every time I sweat	 cry	 brush my teeth	 or get wet in any form	 I have a reaction. The dermatologist that diagnosed me believes the symtoms(symptoms)will disapear within six months to a year. After reading the above comments I am not to sure. Most of you said you've had this allergy for 4-40 years! I am blown out of the water!WE NEED TO START A CONVENTION!!!!!I want to talk and meet people with this disorder. I am so glad I located this site to get started!!!!!Everyone! Please keep this going	 the more information we can bring together the better!"	0

I've been to plenty of doctors but they all just tell me to use different soap. I've used every soap under the sun	 none of it helped. I little trick that I have noticed when going for a swim is to put a waterproof sunblock on. I Never get itchy when its on. It seems to created a barrier between my skin and the water. It has to be waterproof	 or obviously it will just wash off. Of course this doesn't help when taking a shower	 but at lest I can go to the beach and not have to worry.Hope this helps.

post_5628581	post_12358	"Thanks everyone for responding to my post! It's two years later and I still have the disease and its worse than before. Now hives come i get nervous and my body temp raises. Winter was horrible because its so bad now when I have to wear my winter coat. Along with this my skin is soooo dry. It will wake me up at night because it itches and hurts so bad. Anytime water/sweat comes into contact my skin makes the hives which also sheds any and all the moisture on my skin. I also have to explain to people why I have hives everywhere and am constantly scratching. Makes me look like a crazy and on top of it I have to say im allergic to water.But anyway in 2 years I've developed tricks that help me.Right after I get out of the shower before I dry off with a towel I put on baby oil. It itches so bad at first but I found that it moisturizes my body more than any lotion does and keeps the itching to a minimum sometimes.Not itching the hives does make it go away faster...but sometimes I just cant take it and freak out and have to itch lolI've learned to just avoid all together swimming and hot tubs..etc. It ***** and because I'm only 22 and want to do this kind of stuff while Im young but now I just deal with it because it's NOT worth it.**Research shows that the preservative sodium bonzaote (sp) makes this condition worse and in my findings it does. 7up is the only soda I can find that doesnt have this. When I drink something else that does have this preservative I will break out in hives just sitting and doing nothing. It is in a lot of other foods..more than you would think. So i try to look at labels and stay away the best i can.Stress def makes my hives worse when I get them	 so when im in the shower i try not to think about stressful things.I've found that hair conditioner is the absolute worst thing for my hives in the shower. I try to eliminate that but if i have to do it i save it for the very last because where ever the conditioner touches like my back or when i rinse off..is instant horrible long lasting itchy hives that are worse than the others.**Sadly its to the point where just standing in the sun gives them to me	I think that with all this itching my skin is more prone to acne because ANYWHERE i scratch i break out or it turns into a blister.Going on meds for this gives me horrible side effects even over the counter ones.To me its not worth it because it never takes away the symptons so its like more suffering.I just deal with it and try to find more tricks which seems there are very few.I seriously hate this disease and just in the years I've had it its become unbearable that I cannot imagine what it will be like in years to come."	0

post_5709743	post_12358	Hi! I'm Rey from Iran. I've had water urticaria since 4 years ago. I get red itchy hives usually on my back and legs whenever I swim in the sea or the pool. Then these red hives turn into dark brown spots if I scratch them or if they suffer some sort of pressure like pressure of swimsuit bands. Even taking antihistamin pills an hour before swimming doesnot help. No doctor has ever given me any effective treatment. They just advise me to keep away from water and not swim! This makes me crazy since swimming is my best hobby. I'm really upset about this. I hope skin specialists read these comments too!	0

We called to see if they added anything new to the city water.    That summer at the beach I had the same reaction.    (The look on my friends_   faces when they saw all of the hives was priceless.)    I knew then it had to be something that is in all water.    Now any type of liquid causes me to have an reaction.

(I would have thought they would jump at a chance to treat this since its suppose to be so rare.)    For the first few years	 every DR I went to said I did not have Aquagenic Urticaria.    They said my problem was that I had a lot of others allergies which made my skin very sensitive.    He first tested me for a rare cancer.    That scared me to death	 but lucky it came back negative.    Then    my DR suggested I remove everything my skin ***** test showed I was allergic to.    I did this for 6 months while using special shampoo	 eliminating foods that contained certain food dyes	 not dying my hair	 and not wearing any perfume.    My condition did not get any better.    I even developed more nasal allergies (which have never improved).    At this point my DR finally agreed that I had Aquagenic Urticaria and told me to stay on an antihistamine.

post_6184837	post_12358	"Hello	Unfortunately for me	 I believe I can top most of your stories. You see I have had Aquagenic Pruritus for about 4 yrs now. I have had to quite cross country running and all sports. I am always tired and in pain. AP is just the water caused itching and pain. But I have only been getting worse through the yrs. I have taken about 20 something different meds now and also went through light therapy. Nothing has worked. Although xyzal 5mg everyday seems to help take the edge of the itching.This past week I went to Duke med for an annual 2 month appointment and thats when everything started spinning for me. I am now one of the rarest of the rare. Usually a person has either AP or AU. I have been diagnosed with both. Something that is really never seen.I am a 17 year old	 a senior in High School	 I have dreams of going to Winthrop and teaching art to high schoolers. But all of this is uncertain now. I am so sick I can barley get through my day now. My immune system is almost non existent at this point so I currently have mono	 swollen tonsils	 an enlarged spleen	 severe bone pain	and much more going on	 all on top of having Ap and AU.I am on daily steroids to help get ride of all the infections in my body and then we are going to work on my immune system and then hopefully the AP and AU.I was told that the doctors only concern is my quality of life. This quit honestly scares me alot. I cry still thinking about what my life may be in 2	 3	 5 years.So now that you know a little of me story I hope that some of you may feel better about your situations.~Heather"	0

post_6988745	post_12358	"So sad to see people suffer like this...    Anybody tried Chinese herb or doctor?    I've been a seminar and there were amazing stories about rare diseases.    Lots of the ways to heal is related to diet.    I have a friend	 her son had Leukemia and was about to have chemo.    She went to China and met an old Chinese doctor who instructed a very simple diet for her son.    He was cured in 6 months with no chemo.    She is studying Chinese med now.Basically I believe it is all related to your health condition.    When you had good diet	 enough sleep	 adequete exercise	 your body condition(immune system improves.)    When I don't have enough sleep	 spring is like a nightmare to me.    When I have enough sleep	 good mood	 I don't even have any allergic symptom.    My son got hive recently each time he went to swim.    He never had this before but he has been sick and weak(had flu and cold) for a few months.    He just turned 11 and just got vaccines -Tdap and MMR.    He works out a lot in basketball team and waterpolo.    Personally I think it's too much for a kid.    But his dad thought exercise is good for him.    Somehow I think the human body is giving out warning sign telling its master that it can not take it anymore.

One day when I was about 15	 we just opened the pool about mayish and I went in and ended up breaking out all over in hives. Had somewhat warm shower and was fine. Thought it could be the chlorine or chemicals and stuff. Happened a few months later at a lake this time (fresh water.)The next time I was at the doctors I mentioned it. He said its rare but not uncommon. Basically told me to do more research if I wanted to. Since mine wasn't sever	 he told me to just take an allergy pill before going into water temps that differ from body temp. Also to gradually get used to the water	 so if a pool real cold to slowly get in and not to jump in. And to make sure people are around when swimming.Since hives are caused by the blood going to your skin	 if it's drastic temperature change to your body the blood will rush to your skin	 and could faint and drown.( if it was real sever) But just to take a reactine before/ and gradually get used to the water.katie"	0

post_7598787	post_12358	"I am amazed at how many people suffer from this condition and doctors still know nothing about it. I have had aquagenic urticaria since I was born. Mom told me she freaked out the first time she bathed me. I am like most of you allergic to any form of water touching my skin (shower	 swimming	 rain	 sweat). It's not when water drys on my skin	 but when it's there to long. It only happens on my chest	 torso	 back	 and neck. Through the years it's never gotten any worse and if I leave them alone the go away in about 30 mins. From all the responses there seems to be quite a variety of this disease. I agree that AHs help and aloe lotions take away some of the awful itching	 but i've honestly learned to just endure it knowing if left alone the blotches will go away on their own. The worst of it is the embarrassment of going swimming and friends noticing and having to explain. People never believe you can actually be allergic to water. It sadly makes me feel better that there are others out there who understand. I hope maybe this will make doctors look at this disease with clear minds and pray they find a cure."	0

Sometimes it''s in one or two places and not the other and sometimes I get a free pass and don't get them after showers	 why I don't know but I'm so grateful when that happens and I thank God in tears. I was staring to get them in the morning which happened for about a week	 but they stopped.    Who knows why they came or why they stopped but I did start a new med. which I stopped taking.     I found that while my skin is still wet I start rubbing alot of Aloe gel which cools helps the itching alot. I'm reading alot about drinking Aloe so I will probably try that soon.    I hate taking showers but I like everyone must. I do limit my showers to 2 to 3 times a week and avoid doing anything that will make me sweat which irritates my condition.. I understand that natural herbs take at least 2 weeks to take affect.    The anti-histamine use to work benadrly 	ranidine	 zyertex combinations don't work anymore. My immune system is so overactive that they aren't    effective anymore. Three days ago I started taking Bio-tumeric. Tumeric is a spice used in cooking mostly by eastern cultures	 but studies have shown it has anti-inflammation properties and balances the immune system. What we have is an overactive immune system and our mast cells send out too many anti-histamines	 over reacting to any irritant which means that our condition is an autoimmune disease it's akin to lupus and shingles. I'm grateful it's not one of those	 because these hives are hell enough. Also funnel and camomile are other herbs said to help.I find my life so restricted by this problem.

post_7863277	post_12358	Aquagenic Urticaria. is a paralysis in the skin nerves. The wind energy can not move inside as it lacks mineral the Calcium. This calcium can be sent through the skin by lighting holy lamp with ghee and few combination of herbals. If you need more information please mail me.This disease forms in the womb itself or the calcium in the skin nerve is absorbed by the sudden development of Phosphorus and iron in blood that passes through the skin nerve.

post_7894514	post_12358	"I do not have this	 but I have other allergies (including hives	 but they never last more than an hour and I have no idea what brings them on as they are rare).    However I have 2 ideas for y'all.(1) (You can read about this in the OmegaRX Zone	 by Dr. Baryy Sears	 PhD Lipid science).    Inflammatory cytokines are made in the process of metabolizing non-omega-3 fats (maybe omega-6	 not sure).    The enzymes used to metabolise these fats are the same ones that metabolise omega-3 fats.    If you take a high dose of omega-3 (7-9g/day) it uses up the enzymes so you cannot make inflammatory cytokines.    (So obviously this won't help you if they are already made	 but will prevent more being made - so like other allergy drugs like Flonase	 start it the day before you need it).    It uncrabs my head and I have the worst hayfever my allergist has ever seen.    Also	 I have seen studies showing high dose omega-3 can actually cure (not just treat) psoriasis.    So I think this strategy might be particularly useful with skin allrgies.(2) Someone said their problem arose after a trip to the dentist.    Dentists used to give laughing gas	 which destroys vitamin B12.    I belonged to a forum of people with methylation problems	 and they found that some of their allergies improved when they improved their methylation.    Well	 I also improved my methylation and the only thing that improved was allergy to bug bites (a skin allergy).    So maybe it would help your skin allergy.    You improve methylation by taking active B vitamins and TMG (betaine).    As an example	 an active B supplement is made by Thorne	 I think Pure Encapsulations also makes one (not sure	 I use Thorne).    These include methylcobalamine and adenosylcobalamine (active B12s)	 methylfolate (active folate)	 and P5P (active B6).    I purchase the TMG separately from Soloray in 1g dose.    Others on the forum found that increasing methylation increases the need for potassium	 500mg or more (we take as powder in a drink).    You cannot do this if you have any sort of kidney problem as then you cannot excrete potassium.    I am not a doctor.    But electrolyte problems are serious.    What happens is that many people have a malfunctioning methyl cycle (that's a biochemical cycle) due to either genetics or poor diet (junk food	 overprocessed food).    The methyl cycle enzymes use B vitamins and betaine as cofactors.    Some people genetically have enzymes that cannot hang on to these cofactors	 others are just not getting the vitamin cofactors in their diet.    The methyl cycle makes methyl groups (carried by SAMe	 the universal methyl donor	 throughout the body) and methyls are used to turn on/off chemical reactions.    So w/o enough methyls many reactions that should be ON are left OFF.    When you allow them to be turned ON	 you open up additional biochemical pathways which also need different vitamin cofactors (that's why they are called VITAMINS	 they are required for life!).    So you really should take a good multi vitamin.    But the most serious need will be for more potassium...at least that is what we have found.    But we take many	 many other supplements as well as once your biochemical pathways are working ALL vitamins are needed!    You are on your own if you try this.    I suggest researching the methyl biochemical cycle.    Here are a few sites that might help to get you started: http://www.enzymestuff.com/methylation.htmhttp://www.heartfixer.com/AMRI-Nutrigenomics.htm"	1
post_7894530	post_12358	"I forgot to mention that with solution (1) (which is the safest solution because you don't have to know anything much to try it)	 you need a very pure omega-3.    Pharmaceutical grade.    Because otherwise there will be algae fats in the omega-3 and they will irritate your stomach at that high dose.    This is all spelled out in the book by Barry Sears (who also is the author of the Zone Diet books	 also based on biochemistry)."	1

post_7951670	post_12358	"I'm a 20-year-old female from Belgium and I've had aquagenic urticaria since I was 12. It just appeared out of the blue one day. It started on my back (the upper part)	 then slowly spread (day by day) to other parts as well. Now everything is ""affected"" after contact with water	 except for my feet	 legs and hands. I used to shower daily at that time - for the last two years I've been trying to shower only 3 to 4 times a week	 only for a few minutes (except when I have to wash my hair).I get these itchy(!) hives when I take a bath	 when I shower	 when I go swimming in a swimming pool or in the ocean	 when I shower	 etc. Even my own sweat triggers a reaction. Whether the water is cold or hot makes no difference. They usually appear after about 5 to 10 minutes	 and it takes about one or two hours for them to disappear again.I went to the dermatologist and she gave me an ointment with cortisone which I had to use on the hives when they would appear. The ointment made the hives disappear faster	 but it did not prevent them. The dermatologist then submitted me to some allergy tests but nothing came out (except for an allergy to cobalt and nickel). So she concluded that it must be aquagenic urticaria	 and told me that nothing could be done about it. She mentioned that it was possible to take other	 more advanced	 tests	 but that these were very expensive and that they rarely produced results.She gave me a prescription for antihistaminica (Zyrtec / Ceterizine)	 which prevents the hives when taken daily. This works for me	 but I only use it when I go swimming in public or something like that - I don't like taking too much pills	 and certainly not if I feel tired after taking them.As for my skin in general: it's always rather dry and sensitive. Some moisturizing creams even give me allergic reactions (other than the aquagenic urticaria). But whether my skin is hydrated by a moisturizing cream or not	 doesn't matter: the hives always appear.I also seem to have some kind of allergic rhinitis	 which causes symptoms related to those of having a cold. I recently went to an allergy specialist	 had some ***** tests on my arms	 but I wasn't allergic to any of the allergenes I was tested for. Still	 the symptoms of allergic rhinitis remain...Recently	 I had to take a cure of 10 capsules of Diflucan	 one capsule a week	 because of recurrent vaginal yeast infections. (The active ingredient of Diflucan is ""fluconazole"".) This had an impact on my aquagenic urticaria. After one capsule the number of hives severely diminished	 and after the second capsule	 they were completely GONE. No hives	 no itching	 nothing. This lasted for about 10 weeks	 but as soon as I stopped taking the Diflucan	 the hives gradually came back. A few weeks later	 the doctor prescribed me a second cure of Diflucan	 and the same thing happened: after the second capsule	 my symptoms of aquagenic urticaria completely disappeared. I went to see an allergy/immunology specialist	 but he simply said that he didn't know where that reaction came from - and refused to think deeper about it.(If there is anyone who has similar problems	 or has a similar reaction to Diflucan	 please let me know.)Hope this was detailed enough :)"	0

I am getting better all the time.The Doctors seem to hate this approach.    ""Don't you want to go out with your mates for a pizza?"" asked my doctor when I told him I wanted to avoid all possible allergens.So there it is.    Avoid your allergens.    Mine was my cat.    I had to give him away.    I only eat non-preserved stuff.    Meat	 fruit	 veg	 proper bread	 milk etc.    In other words I avoid anything with man-made stuff in it.    The worst one for me is sulphur dioxide	 and that seems to be in everything from frozen chips (French fries) to fresh prawns.    Give me some long-life pate and I can show you firework display on my skin.I shouldn't go onto your Doctor about this too much though	 especially if you live in the UK or US because they rather you eat what you like and they just want to try to treat the symptoms.    Plus	 if everyone avoided sulfites that were allergic to them	 it would really damage our economies.Hope this helps."	1

post_8011529	post_12358	I was born with aquagenic urcticara and I am 15. Anything that has water in it makes me break out in hives for several hours. I recently found out that I am also allergic to olive oil. I really don't know what to do about any of it besides deal with it and take medicine around the clock. It lessens the pain but doesn't stop it completely. I love swimming af being in the rain but my swimming suits and clothes stitck to my skin and makes it worse. I just deal with it and try to act like nothing is wrong when someone asks about it. I would really like someone to talk to about this but there is no one around me that quite understands what is happening to me everyday.~Crystal	0

post_8181663	post_12358	"I was diagnosed with Aquagenic Urticaria in 2009	 although it has been an issue for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed when I went to see a dermatologist for an unrelated case of pityriasis rosea. I asked him if the pityriasis rosea had anything to do with the hives I get when I take a shower or sweat he said no that is a completely different condition. He then asked me a few more questions and the informed me that I have aquagenic urticaria. This is something I have had since I was a child so I am very used to living with it. It is just a normal but very miserable part of who I am. I try to take quick showers and dry off as quickly as possible. I live on the gulf of mexico and I love the water. I also love to swim	 so I have to take an allergy medicine daily if I want to swim without to much misery. I stay indoors most of the day and try to find shade when I do have to be outside. The itching and burning are so intense that I often feel like I will go insane if I can't scratch it. My family doesn't understand how frustrating it is just to take a shower. I have a sister who can somewhat relate because she has the same symptoms and even the hives when her skin is exposed to cold air."	0
post_8204342	post_12358	"I'm 20 and I've been braking out now for about 6 years. Doctors never really bothered to completely diagnose me for almost 5 years	 I was just put on antihistamines and each time I would complain they had stopped working they would just up my dose. I have always know what it was and it wasn't until the start of this year that my doctor sent me to the hospital.Although my experience to being diagnose was very nice as often doctors had never heard or it or just didn't understand and therefore some of them presumed I was over reacting and they where then ofter rude to me; in the end I had to take    pictures of what was happening and show them in order for something to be done.My most recent doctor really helped	 he explained all about the h1	h2 and h3 receptors and after he had gone through it I was able to google those terms and look it up a bit more in order for me to understand. I now take 360mg a day of fexofenadine hydrochloride for when my skin comes in to contact with water and also 300mg a day of Ranitidine as I was complaining of stomach problems and the doctor said this was to do with too much acid being built up in my stomach because of this allergy	 and so far so good as both these dose's have been working for me for almost 8 months now; longer then any other medication every has :).I know this is long but I hope this has helped	 please don't be afraid to write back :)!Katie :)"	0
post_8259762	post_12358	"HelloI too suffer from Aquagenic Urticaria.    I have never been fully diagnosed	 but my systems are that of the same.    After any exposure to water whether it is from a shower	 pool	 lake or bath it is all the same (well actually the hotter the water the worse it is!)	 10 mins after my legs and arms itch and prickly burn so bad I feel like I would rather rip off my skin for some relief and this feeling last just over an hour.    Some times there are very slight red bumps (hives) but most of the time there is no physical evidence.The worst part about this is that I LOVE to swim!! I am currently pregnant and even before I was pg	 I was over weight	 so swimming was and still is my favourite way of working out because it reduces the strain on my joints.Now because of this reaction to water	 I have been almost scared to even step foot in a pool (at least salt water is better than chlorinated).    A few weeks ago now I was up at our cottage	 relaxing on the dock	 and I totally forgot to put sunscreen on.    Oops	 but here_  s the thing! Yes I got a sun burn	 not bad enough that I was blistering	 one of those burns that last for about 2 days and turn to a tan_  À_. The following day I decided to tough it out and cool off in the lake as I was cooking.    I jumped in quickly and climbed out again	 bracing for the itch	 it didn_  t end up coming_  À_.. so I went back in and spent a little longer in_  À_.again no itch.    I was soooooooooooo excited to have discovered this!    I had a little bit of itching in locations that I didn_  t have a sun burn	 but it was nothing in compared to what it normally is like.    YEAH!!!Now I warn you	 the burn only lasts for a few days and for me the no itching only lasted for about 2-3 days after the burn faded away.

post_8305454	post_12358	"I am 63 years old and have had aquagenic uticaria since I was 14.    I still have it today.     Everyone has my sympathy who has this condition. I use atarax just before showering or swimming (fortunately a mild dose of a 25 mg) is all I need to help with the itching.    I have used this since I was 19 years old and have had no side affects from it.    It may make you slightly sleepy.    (It does not stop the itching just helps reduce the time of it and the severity of it)I also find now that I am older that using as hot water as you can stand and then hitting with straight cold for a very very short time after down showering can reduce the itching.    I also use the new microfiber towels and only PAT do not rub dry and that helps reduce the itching.    this is a hereditary problem and as someone above said it is not a true allergery to water.     I was told over and over that it is a physical reaction that when water hits your body something comes to the surface of your skin and when water hits that that is what causes the hives.My mom took me to 5 doctors who all told her the same thing in the early 1960's.    that i had aquagenic uticaria.    They told me to never swim alone because you never know how severe a reaction you may have at any time and the way you react could change.I was told also that it is hereditary and both of our sons have some form of this condition (fortunately neither is as severe as I was when younger).I found out an aunt has a form of it.I have had problems with my own sweat and rain causing me to itch and have hives.    When hospitalized the sheets are thin and no padding to protect you from the vinyal cover on the mattress	 so your sweat will break you out in hives.    therefore after this happening several times in the hospital they now tell me to bring my own bedding which includes a mattress pad.As I face getting older and not seeing this condition going away just the severity of the reaction changing (I still itch all the time    just how severe is the change)    of course my mind thinks how in the world if I land in a nursing home is this condition going to be handled?"	0

post_4547499	post_4547022	you could do a IVP xray of the kidneys looking for problems.. usually a urine test will show red or white blood cells or protein in the urine.    I've heard kidney problems can give serious nausea..especially if a stone is stuck.    But normally that's detected on a ct scan.Sounds like some sort of allergy though.. maybe gluten free/lactose free diet for a good week or 2.    Hard to do.    Also you could go to an allergist and see if something is up.    I went to one and found out I was allergic to oats without even knowing..Nausea is hard.. I don't have a job now..near toally broke.    Hope we both figure it out..and soon!	0
post_4547502	post_4547022	btw bad constipation and nausea usually is a sign of allergy.. so it's something to check into.    Also i've heard of false negatives with celiac blood tests.    I'm tempted to try this gluten free diet as well.	0
post_4547508	post_4547022	"Has your diet been addressed?    Have they suggested you see a nutritionist to learn of foods to avoid or add to your diet?    Stress can cause nausea	 which leads to not eating	 to weight loss.    Have they addressed the stress issue?    I would try taking Miralax as it is not habit forming and works well for the constipation.    Check what you are eating to see if something just doesn't agree with you.    Add fiber to your diet	 slowly	 small amounts	 as too much fiber will cause the same symtoms(symptoms).    What about IBS?    Have they mentioned this?    Even if it is stress related	 this needs to be addressed.    You may not feel stressed	 but still may be.    NEVER give up	 something is obviously wrong.    At your age and having the extensive GI work up	 I feel it has to be food or stress related.    If you are eating a lot of fiber	 cut way back	 if not add some.    Eat foods that are easily digestible	 and try the Miralax.    Then make an appt. to address the stress	 it can't hurt and may help.    You are in a position where you have to start ruling things out.    Have they done any recent bloodwork on you?    I would assume they have	 if not ask about it."	0
post_4547597	post_4547022	"Stress is the thing all of the doctors seem to be falling back on with no tests showing anything.    (by the way	 I've had an extensive allergy test and tried various diets to see if it was lactose/glueten etc) Its just hard for me to chalk it up to stress because I've always been the most care free person. I never even really felt depressed until about 2 years (and 20lbs down) into the symptoms. I defiantly know stress makes it worse	 but to me it was the stomach issues that slowly broke me down over the years.    I also found that when I was taking proton pump inhibitors(prevacid	 etc)	 my appetite and calorie intake would drop dramatically. The resulting malnourishment is what brought about the most stressful situations and feelings of despair.

Lactose intolerance is a side effect of gluten so it STILL could be a gluten celiac problem...there's really only a few basic ones..like fructose intolerance/gluten/lactose... so I would just eliminate (it's hard..) but eliminate gluten and dairy from your diet for a good month or two.    You might as well..that's what i'm doing right now..dairy has helped me big time..before I was a heavy dairy milk drinker..also you could just completely empty yourself out like prepping for a colonoscopy.. if you're still nauseated being empty of all food/waste I would think that would suggest something else other than just the typical IBS junk... something else to try.

post_2622749	post_2610808	"Actually	    there have been studies which show the connection between thimerosal and autism.    The Geiers published a study in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons	 spring 2006 (http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7009643619) which discussed the early downward trends of autism following the removal of thimerosal from vaccines.    And another study in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry showed a continuous rise of autism in California from 1995 to 2007 (http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7009643619) despite the removal of thimerosal.    Thimerosal is still added to flu vaccines and the CDC has recommended it as part of the vaccine schedule just as thimerosal was phased out of other childhood vaccines.There was a survey done recently that revealed that vaccinated children are two and a half times more likely to have neurological disorders(http://www.pharmalive.com/News/index.cfm?articleid=454629&categoryid=10).I find it amazing and revealing that no study has been done comparing vaccinated children to unvaccinated children which would settle the issue once and for all.

I should also point out that the study which showed a rise of autism following removal in thimerosal assumes that the only thing in vaccines that cause autism is mercury. The ingredients in vaccines include aluminum	 engine coolant and formaldehyde	 among others. Also	 the assumption that the only source of mercury is from the shots given the child	 when a pregnant mother who receives flu shots or other mercury-laced injections could be the source."	0

post_2623079	post_2610808	"Yeah	 I've been looking into it for a number of years	 actually	 and I too at first believed in the vaccination program.

The HepB vaccine-diabetes link is really strong (http://www.webmd.com/news/20000613/hepatitis-b-vaccine-linked-to-onset-of-diabetes).

He makes a good point: ""'As Vaclav Havel once said: ""Follow the man who seeks the truth; run from the man who has found it."" I can't tell you that we know that the MMR vaccine causes autism.

I just got a little confused.    I really don't think it does.    That's just my personal opinion though ...although I will hold off on some shots until right before my child goes to school.    I've known families who haven't given there children the shots and they still have children on the spectrum.    I think it has a lot to do with timing of the disorder.    Who knows??

post_2627717	post_2610808	"Yes	 I'm a teacher	 a special ed teacher and I can assure you that we have seen a rise in autism and it's not just a diagnostic issue. The UPI report	 Dan Olmsted did a series on autism over the last couple of years and one (of many) articles he wrote really made the point.http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20051204-060313-6829r' thousands of children cared for by Homefirst Health Services in metropolitan Chicago have at least two things in common with thousands of Amish children in rural Lancaster: They have never been vaccinated. And they don't have autism. ""We have a fairly large practice. We have about 30	000 or 35	000 children that we've taken care of over the years	 and I don't think we have a single case of autism in children delivered by us who never received vaccines	"" said Dr. Mayer Eisenstein	 Homefirst's medical director who founded the practice in 1973. Homefirst doctors have delivered more than 15	000 babies at home	 and thousands of them have never been vaccinated. The few autistic children Homefirst sees were vaccinated before their families became patients	 Eisenstein said. ""I can think of two or three autistic children who we've delivered their mother's next baby	 and we aren't really totally taking care of that child -- they have special care needs. But they bring the younger children to us. I don't have a single case that I can think of that wasn't vaccinated.""...""We do have enough of a sample	"" Eisenstein said. ""The numbers are too large to not see it. We would absolutely know. We're all family doctors. If I have a child with autism come in	 there's no communication. It's frightening. You can't touch them. It's not something that anyone would miss.""'I believe there is a genetic component to autism	 but it's the loaded gun - and the shot is the trigger.     Maybe getting vaccinated when your child is older	 say 12	 but then really what's the point?    My husband hasn't been vaccinated against anything in 20 years and has never gotten any of the diseases they vaccinate kids for	 flu included.If you're healthy you don't get sick.Another good book to read is ""Evidence of Harm""(http://www.amazon.com/Evidence-Harm-Vaccines-Epidemic-Controversy/dp/B000JU7MQ6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205236584&sr=1-1)It's a history of how the ""Mercury Moms"" fought for years to get thimerosal out vaccines and how the CDC fought tooth and nail to hide the autism-thimerosal link.

post_3065325	post_2153469	"Hi	'Anti-itch drugs	 often antihistamine	 may reduce the itch during a flare up of eczema	 and the reduced scratching in turn reduces damage and irritation to the skin.They do not cure eczema	 but are highly effective in controlling or suppressing symptoms in most cases.For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g. hydrocortisone or desonide)	 whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid (e.g. clobetasol propionate	 fluocinonide).Eczema can be exacerbated by dryness of the skin. Moisturizing is one of the most important self-care treatments for sufferers of eczema. Keeping the affected area moistened can promote skin healing and relief of symptoms.Light therapy using ultraviolet light can help control eczema. UVA is mostly used	 but UVB and Narrow Band UVB are also used. Ultraviolet light exposure carries its own risks	 particularly eventual skin cancer from exposure.The first and primary recommendation is that people suffering from eczema shouldn't use detergents of any kind on their skin unless absolutely necessary.Dermatological recommendations in choosing a soap generally include:[citation needed]* Avoid harsh detergents or drying soaps* Choose a soap that has an oil or fat base; a ""superfatted"" goat milk soap is best* Use an unscented soap* Patch test your soap choice	 by using it only on a small area until you are sure of its results* Use a non-soap based cleanser* Use plain yogurt instead of soap'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EczemaLet us know if you need any further information.Do consult your doctor about this too.Keep us posted on how you are doing and if you have any other doubts.Regards."	1

Please let me know if you have had any success.    Good luck.	0
post_3725032	post_2153469	"I agree about the food sensitivities and allergies.    I have had eczema on my hands that would put most peoples' eczema to shame.    I had a severe allergic reaction to latex gloves from when I had a dishwashing job.    The skin on the backs of both hands literally disintegrated.    That wasn't the end of it.    That was years ago	 when I was much younger than you are now.I have also had eczema that was one giant blister on the heel of either hand when it started.    The blister was about an inch in diameter.    I knew not to pop the things	 but they eventually did this on their own.    It's rather difficult for this to not happen	 since the heel of the hand is on the palm side of the hand.    Even if I tried to avoid certain things	 it was impossible for me to keep my hands completely still.    Oh	 and by the way	 those blisters were so big that they interferred when I had to write and sign my name.I discovered that I am allergic to petroleum based products.    Guess what your commercial detergents are made of?    And	 they're things that the doctor mentioned above to avoid.Getting back to food sensitivities.    Check it out.    Most of us have food sensitivities and allergies that we're unaware of.    Do some research about the basic elimination diet.    It will really help you narrow down which foods you could be sensitive to.    I just read an excellent article on mercola.com that you really should investigate.    You don't have to subscribe to read this great article either.    Go to mercola.com to find the latest newsletter.    Find the article called ""How Yeast Wreaks Havoc on Your Life (Health) and How to Address it"".    This is vital information for just about everyone I know.    It was mentioned that up to 75% of women have this Candidas and don't know about it.    It affects men	 too.    Candidas is linked to many common illnesses	 including food sensitivities and allergies.    Untreated Candidas leads to serious illnesses.    Conventional medicine doesn't really know how to deal with Candidas.    Check this out	 you'll be glad that you did.There are many more natural personal care products that will certainly help with the hand eczema	 because your hands won't be exposed to the irritants that cause the problem nearly so much.    Trust me	 changing your shampoo and conditioner will really help.    Earth Science and Jason both make natural fragrance free shampoos and conditioners.    They are not harsh and drying	 which really helps your hands	 too.Changing your laundry products will also help.    If you have eczema on your hands	 chances are the rest of your skin is affected by the products you use	 too.    Seventh Generation makes a natural laundry soap.    There are a couple of others that you can find at your natural grocery stores.A very big one to change	 though	 is your dish liquid.    Stop using the commercial petroleum based detergents.    They aren't even soap!    Seventh Generation is an excellent dish liquid.    Don't worry about the lack of suds compared to your commercial products.    Your dishes will still be plenty clean enough.    There is a reason for this with all natural products	 including your shampoos.    They don't contain the well-known carcinogen sodium lauryl (laureth) sulfate (SLS) or any of its derivatives.    Manufacturers add this to their products to create an unnatural lather that we're all programmed to believe is normal and necessary.    It's not.    SLS is harsh on the skin and very drying and should be avoided for this reason alone.    I found an excellent type of hand soap that is made from vegetable glycerin (there's your fat) and doesn't irritate the skin.    It has a wide variety of choices.    I use the one that has no added fragrances and is just called ""natural""	 because I don't do well with any scents	 including the natural ones.    The company is called Sappo Hill.    The soap cakes are round.    I found that candle bases for pillar candles work great as soap dishes for this differently shaped soap.    I found the one I'm using now that someone was getting rid of.    It's made of pottery	 too.    They have two varieties of soaps made with different grades of oatmeal.    This	 too	 could prove helpful to you	 because oatmeal is supposed to be soothing for the skin.    I don't use the oatmeal ones	 because I'm gluten intolerant.    Whatever you use on your skin (largest organ for your body) still enters your blood stream.    But	 the finely milled oatmeal variety might work well for your eczema	 too.    The natural one is the most neutral one	 though	 that I have found.    You'll love the price of the Sappo Hill soaps	 too.    They are so affordable that there is no excuse for even the sickest and most sensitive person to go without bathing and remaining clean.Watch out	 because SLS is also in your toothpaste.    There are natural toothpastes that don't contain any SLS.    You have to watch out even with the natural ones and read the ingredients to make sure they don't sneak SLS into an otherwise acceptable product.    One brand that doesn't have this is called Waleda.    It's a company in Germany.    They even have a variety of toothpaste that has a natural pink color	 due to the herb that makes it that color.Another big help is to actually go without using ANY soap that isn't absolutely necessary.    Well	 this works out great for my dry skin and hair.    You can actually get in the shower and massage your scalp without using any shampoo or conditioner at all.    This will actually help even if your hair is oily by nature.    You're still removing the excess oil and dirt	 but without torturing your skin.    This is really great for people with dry scalp and hair	 because it will stimulate the scalp into producing the oils necessary for the skin and hair	 because you're not stripping your scalp and hair either.Again	 this isn't your hands	 but you're keeping your hands out of harm's way by doing these change overs.    I speak from experience.Also	 find a good body lotion or cream that you can use on your hands	 too	 that isn't petroleum based.The cleansers that the doctor was talking about that have no detergent or soap base can also be found at the natural markets.    Earth Science makes an excellent line of affordable products.    They have cleansers and moisturizers for the face that are even fragrance free.    I have Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) and I'm not experiencing problems with this line.    The same may not be true of every person with MCS for every product.    I learned that the hard way when I had a severe reaction to face moisturizing cream made by Jason that burned my skin.    It's natural	 but it's not fragrance free.    It clearly has herbs in it that I am very allergic to.    On the other hand	 I know someone with MCS who can use this one without any problems whatsoever.    Now	 you know why I go for fragrance free even with the natural products	 though.I haven't had any hand eczema since I made these changes in my environment and checked for food sensitivities.    And	 I have had it very severely	 as you read in my descriptions."	1
post_6534960	post_2153469	"Hello	Were you tested for gluten intolerance? You might consider visiting www.enterolab.com for more information. I discovered that I was gluten intolerant after having the following symptoms: migraines	 dizzy spells	 lightheadedness	 menstrual cycle issues etc. Now that I have been off of gluten	 most of my symptoms have gone away.Recently	 however	 I came into contact with gluten and developed eczema patches over my eyes. Gluten exposure leads to auto-immune reactions in my system and can flare up this way.    I know that this is a symptom of gluten intolerance and am doing my best to find where I might be getting cross contamination.Although creams may help in the short term	 keep in mind that the issue is usually coming from the inside out."	1
post_6537541	post_2153469	"Although I commented some time ago	 it is worth reiterating that you may or may not test positive for gluten intolerance but still find yourself to be gluten intolerant.    The tips the good doctor provided will help.    The stuff I already mentioned only compliment what the good doctor said.    Often	 conventional and natural medicine do agree on some of these points	 such as being careful about which products one uses for personal care products when one has eczema.    Certainly	 againstthegrain and I are in agreement about the gluten	 in that avoiding gluten has certainly helped both of us.    And	 we both pay if we come into contact with gluten.It sounds very strange but you will find that avoiding gluten has great potential of reducing your misery during your menstrual cycle.    I used to suffer so much more than I do now.    I'm not 100% pain free	 and I'm still dealing with heavy cycles.    However	 the severity and duration of the pain is so much better and even how heavy the cycles has been greatly reduced.    They're still heavy	 just not nearly as heavy.    So gluten definitely does play a role in this.    I also don't get the giant blood clots that I was getting before I discovered how bad gluten was for me in more ways than one.    I was very happy when I finally noticed the giant blood clots were gone.    That's big	 because no doubt the uterus contractions were so much more painful because of working so hard to pass these blood clots.    I'm thinking this because I used to always notice that the pain from the cramping greatly reduced as soon as those monstosities passed.    They were so big I could feel them when they passed.    Now	 if I cheat and it's close to time for my period	 I will get a bit of a blood clot (not as much as when I didn't know of course) and a slight increase in the cramping.    So	 there is definitely a connection.    I don't know the scientific or biological reasons for this stuff and how much a woman suffers with the menstruation	 but I know my experience with this is at least anecdotal evidence.    Someone with knowledge of why gluten does this when we menstruate will have to explain why things work this way.Sorry it was so graphic	 but maybe this will help another young woman to find a way to reduce the suffering surrounding menstruation.    What can I say	 when I quit the gluten for the colon issues and the eczema issues I had a happy surprise with less suffering during menstruation	 too.    So	 I don't care what the fancy lab work doesn't say in my case concerning whether certain doctors believe me about being gluten intolerant or not	 because my own life's experience and this anecdotal evidence says that I'm right and it's my colon health and my skin health and my women's health issues I'm dealing with--not the doctors who doubt me just because their stupid test says I'm not gluten intolerant.Save your money and just experiment with going off of gluten for a few months just to see the change you experience for yourself.    If your experience is like mine and it says you're negative concerning gluten intolerance	 that doesn't mean that you're not gluten intolerant.    I know	 because I definitely suffer a whole lot less when I'm not cheating.    My one primary doctor who has seen the eczema flare up as bad as I described above doesn't doubt me.    She has seen the change for the better.    Even the allergist believes me and he knows what I say about food intolerance versus food allergy is true when concerning conventional medicine.    The enterolab site that was mentioned is a different test than the one recognized by conventional medicine.    I never had a chance to use that one	 but I know it's a good place.    A friend of mine who had a longer list of food intolerances than mine recommended it.    But	 if you are short on money	 you can save a lot of money simply by seeing if you experience changes for the better when you stop gluten entirely.Stay away from dairy while you are doing this	 too.    If you read up on this	 you will find that many who are diagnosed with Celiac have a cross reaction to the casein protein in dairy.    I've found that this isn't everyone who has Celiac	 but enough do that it is worth just staying away from dairy for the duration of your experiment in order to prevent cross reactions that may lead you to conclude that you're not gluten intolerant when you actually are.    While one is gluten intolerant	 it doesn't necessarily mean that it is Celiac	 however some view gluten intolerance as a less severe form of Celiac.    Either way	 the treatment for both is AVOIDANCE of all forms of gluten.    Anyway	 take a look at the Celiac forum and you'll find the information there about casein."	1
post_7981201	post_2153469	"Hi H 28. This is an immune system issue. When pregnant some components of your immune system are down regulated (or modulated in a particular way) otherwise the immune system would attack the embryo.    This modulation is the reason why women with a variety of immune related issues have reduced symptoms or are symptom free during pregnancy.The issue for you however is that your immune system is activated unnecessarily at times. The symptoms will rise and fall according to underlying immune system cycling and intersection with allergens. Step 1. Get the Physical things right. Diet - avoid the antagonists such as ""bad foods"" chemicals etc	 get your teeth checked by an integrative dental practitioner - reason is bad teeth	 dental implants and root canalled teeth enable dental bacteria to get into the blood stream and produce endo-toxins which will cause a variety of inflammatory disorders. If you have a root canalled tooth or teeth I would get them out - your choice. Next physical step is to eliminate fungal infections as a possible issue	 they also produce toxins which can be disastrous and cause reactive inflammation - strict diet is a first step but add good quality probiotics - essential. Then you must do exercise - weight bearing is better because it increases stem cell activity and this also regulates immune activity - brings about homeostasis - balance to the immune system. See ""Crohn's disease Osiris clinical study"" on web - stem cells can have dramatic effects on inflammation.http://www.osiris.com/prod_crohns.phpStep 2 is the Mental - being calm and being positively occupied may need some focus. There are many things one could do here from relaxation programs to meditation to transformative courses. Different things work better for different people - but getting to a calm state is important. Add in a positive psychology lesson - see books - Flourish and the Optimistic Child by Martin Seligman. People who are flourishing add to their vibrancy and good health.Think about your immune system as an adaptive system that plastic and can change - you can change it over time just like your brain is adaptive and if injured it can recover - see the Brain that Changes Itself by Norman Doige. It takes time but your immune system can be modified to be less reactive but you have to get rid of antagonists first and then activate your normal body functions and de-stress mentally and then be positively engaged in creating things - your life and your children's lives etc etc.Back to immune cycles - these are just starting to be understood by the medical research community. Like the menstrual cycle there is an immune cycle - but it switches on and off over 6 to 8 days not the 28 to 30 days of the menstrual cycle. if you are having symptoms of skin and other irritation/inflammation then the Inflammation will mainly occur as it switches on and build its activity over about 3 days. eg with T cells (part of your immune system) they are activated and then after about 3 days they are down regulated by Treg cells and then about 3 days later the T cells turn on again. You can get an idea of where the cycle is by accurate temperature measures every day using an inner ear electronic digital thermometer (the other way is to get CRP measures from your blood which is much more complicated and needs your doctor to organise). Plot the temperatures and join the dots and you will see the wave of the cycle. Best to do every 12 hours. You might then make sure you have a very relaxing day when the cycle is at the bottom of activity - this is when the temperature is lowest and the immune cells as being activated. eg have a hot soothing bath and have a calm ""look after yourself"" day. Weight bearing exercise is better done before the bottom of the cycle so that the stem cells are activated the day before the T cells are activated.This probably sounds a little weird	 but it's worth a try. As we find out more about the immune system cycles it will have a dramatic effect on many illnesses like cancer	 auto immune diseases and infectious diseases. Check the web for ""immune cycles Ashdown"" and ""immune cycles 7 day Huggins""."	1

These drug combinations shrank the tumors of nearly half the women (45%) treated. In contrast	 less than one third (29%) of those women who received chemotherapy alone had a similar response. When Herceptin was added to the chemotherapy	 it boosted survival by an average of 5 months compared to chemotherapy alone.A small number of the women taking the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin had significant heart problems	 including congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump effectively. Adriamycin was blamed for most of this effect. Herceptin on its own rarely causes heart damage. But the two drugs given together resulted in more heart damage than expected. For this reason	 the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin is no longer recommended.Navelbine chemotherapy combined with Herceptin has also been studied recently in clinical trials.----------------------------------------------Serious heart side effectsResearch News:Preliminary results from the HERA Trial: Herceptin Taken Less Frequently at Higher Doses Does Not Increase Risk of Heart Damage Less commonly	 Herceptin can damage the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.

Slightly more often (about 7% of the time)	 Herceptin causes mild heart failure.Women who experience mild or more serious heart damage can stop taking Herceptin and start taking heart-strengthening medications. This often brings heart function back to normal.While heart damage can be more severe when Herceptin is given along with other chemotherapy drugs known to cause heart damage	 including Adriamycin (chemical name: doxorubicin) and possibly other drugs like it.Taking Herceptin with the chemotherapy drug Taxol (chemical name: paclitaxel) does not increase your risk of severe heart damage. Studies have shown that this combination causes only slightly more mild heart damage than Herceptin alone. Women in clinical trials who are receiving Herceptin plus Taxol are being watched very closely for this effect.Testing your heart before and during Herceptin treatmentBefore starting Herceptin therapy	 you should have an echocardiogram or a MUGA scan to check how well your heart is functioning.An echocardiogram uses sound waves to take detailed pictures of the heart as it pumps blood. For this quick test	 you lie still for a few minutes while a device that gives off sound waves is briefly placed on your ribs	 over your heart. There is no radiation exposure with this tes"	1

post_1929047	post_1905230	"I have 3 children.    One has pdd (pervaisive developmental disorder) which is an asd or autism spectrum disorder.    My oldest child shows the same symptoms only more exaggerated.    No one ever told me this but...contact a developmental pediatrician.    They are the only people that can properly diagnose an asd.    mary t did mention some good resources but most of the drs. she mentioned are not trained throughly in developmental delays.    I never knew until 6 months ago that this is where my oldest child should have been evaluated rather than a psychiatrist.    Do it now as the wait is typically 6 yo 8 months to be seen.    If you are right and it is an asd...early intervention works wonders.    Without the early interventions my 3 yr. old would be worse off and if my 8 yr. old gotten early intervention she would be better off.    Yes what you describe can be symptoms of an asd but that by far does not mean your child has it.    Please make an appointment with a developemental pediatrician.    I would also recommend that you contact your local school district and inform them that you would like an evaluation for your child's delays as they should generally have more communicative skills at 14 months than you describe.    Testing and evaluations for such are paid for by the school district in NY and I think it is the same in every state.    The people that do the testing are trained to spot such things and you are always involved in the process.    Some kids are just late talker but you will never know if it is that or something more serious unless you check it out.Doing these things is a right royal pain some times but better to do it and find out you are wrong than not do it and find out years from now that you really should have followed up on your concern.    Don't ever let anyone tell you that you are being paranoid or overly concerned.    I got that a lot.On the gluten free diet:    there are no conclusive results on that but yes some children do better on a gluten free diet.    Symptoms can also be eased by ""going green"" or eliminating artificial ingredients as much as possible from your child's diet.    This I have found to be helpful from personal experience.One final suggestion:    get hooked up with a support group online or in your local community for parent's of asd children.    I have found simply talking to other parents helps.    Sometimes you get great ideas and sometimes you give them.autism spectrum disorders are autism	 aspergers syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder.    There are tons of great books you can read to get more info.    If you like I can provide you with a few great titles that I have found to be a huge help for me.As a side note:    autism or asd IS NOT always rain man.    Too many people don't know this.    You never have to tell anyone about that label if you don't want to	 your child isn't doomed to a life in a facility	 and autistic children have just as bright a future as any other child.    Many adults with more mild asds would never be noticed as different when there was early intervention.Please excuse my rambling (passionate about the topic i guess)."	1

There are so many things you cannot eat though.    You have to avoid any foods basically that cause inflammation.    This is the same diet Jenny put her son on except the website she gave out does not follow the same regiment.

post_2084566	post_1905230	"Thank you so much for your question- I will address your concerns to the best of my ability although you must realize that I am unable to examine your child and obtain a history and thus my response should be considered as informative rather than as a diagnosis.    Let me begin by giving you some background.As some of the others on the forum have alluded to	 autism is part of a spectrum of disorders referred to in the medical community as the pervasive developmental disorders.    This group of developmental problems include Autism	 Rett's Syndrome	 Asperger Syndrome	 childhood disintegration disorder	 and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified; Rett's and Autism are on the more severe end of the spectrum with Asperger's generally causing more mild developmental impairment.    A few years back	 there was quite a bit of commotion in the media regarding linkage of autism with vaccination; this connection has yet to be substantiated within the literature and there are mere select cases that have been reported but no clear association between the two.When evaluating a child for developmental delay	 there are various areas that are evaluated	 particularly social and language skills.    When looking at language	 things to consider are whether the child has been delayed on reaching language milestones 	 and	 if delayed	 is there evidence of regression.    With respect to social interaction	 does your child make eye contact with others? Interact with others? Engage in play with others?    Sometimes abnormalities in social impairment become more apparent once the child enters daycare years.     As you have also alluded to in your question	 children with one of the pervasive developmental disorders may demonstrate repetitive behaviors referred to as stereotypies- arm-flapping is one of the more common ones.The fact that your child interacts with you is encouraging and this hand-flapping that you are noticing may be simple baby play.    To give you an idea of normal development	 at    about 12-14 months	 toddlers will generally be able to say ""mama	"" ""dada	"" ""no.""    Based on what you have told me	 I wouldn't be too worried about your child at this point but I would make sure to follow regularly with your pediatrician.    Your pediatrician would be the best resource for evaluating the developmental progress of your child and can likewise to refer you to developmental specialists for further evaluation should there be concerns for developmental delay.I know that this information is limited	 but I hope it is helpful.    Thank you	 again	 for your question and i wish you the best of luck."	0

post_2302335	post_2286775	"I too have been diagnosed with breast cancer mid December	 unfortunately due to the fact that a year ago I had a mammogram and a scan and they said the 11mm lump in my r/breast was only a cyst so I had no reason for concern as they only wanted to see me in a year time.    The tumour is now 10cm I thought they would just aspirate it as it was only a cyst that was large possibly due to hormone changes as I am now 42yrs old	 the shock of hearing that it was a solid mass was a HUGE shock and then after a biopsy that it was confimed infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma was really unbelievable.    Well both my husband were living in New Zealand at the time on a 3 year work permit and were still busy putting together a medical insurance plan	 obviously too late for that now.    We flew back to South Africa in a matter of days for my 1st chemo treatment here and have friends selling up lock stock and barrel back in NZ.    Our lives changed in a flash	 both being ex paramedics we know the drill about various health issues but unfortunately were mislead from the word go.    No use crying over spoilt milk! We are just getting on with what we have to do and yes only by God's grace have we had the strength to fight this inbetween all the other distractions.    Well I have stage 3 and some swollen lymph nodes	 the first blood tests showed that it had not metastised to other organs although the tumour markers were very high	 my estrogen hormone receptors also came back positive and the rest negative.    It is still very early days and I am trying to do a quick crash course on my condition through the internet which sometimes can really be overwhelming and very scary.    My next chemo is on the 11th Jan 2008 and they will take blood to check the white blood cells before treatment.    I am very blessed to have HUGE support from my loved ones but they too are going through various emotions and sometimes can get difficult.

They are also not saying there is a link - they are just acknowledging that they are looking into it further.    Before they would not.    The ingrediant that was the trigger for autism (believed by many moms) was Thermisol (spell?) and that has been taken out of the vaccine.    I asked my doctor about all of these and he told me that the ingrediant was taken out but he still does not think there is a link but he did say he gets this questions ALL THE TIME.

I find myself trying to diagnose the symptoms myself instead of my doctor because it aches so much. The pain is on my left arm and resonates from my elbow. I use the computer every day and have been since i was 10 years old. I am almost certain all the improper sitting positions and keyboard shortcuts graphic designers	 such as myself	 have to use have something to do with the everyday discomfort. It doesnt hurt at all it which is strange and during the mornings its feels at peace until i sit in the same position for too long or go to lunch and come back to my desk.Coincidently	 I just came back from getting a cortisone shot from my doctor. I was against it since day one but nothing has seemed to help. Oh and I forgot to mention. The first doctor I went to visit about my elbow had a MRI taken and diagnosed it as tendonitis.

post_4736845	post_1388058	"I have the same exact pain and have had it before. Last time I had my back adjusted and haven't had that pain forever. I is usually caused by the 4th and 5th vertebrae. It happens when you slip a disk or have been sleeping wrong or have changed sleeping habits. It is like a throbbing ache that starts in your upper arm/elbow and then after a day or two your whole arm aches. Along with your wrist and forearm after any length of time. Seeing a chiropractor is usually the best bet	 have them adjust you and then go back every month or so to keep the pain from coming back. Problem is usually sleeping habits	 sleeping on your side tends to cause them from happening especially if your a restless sleeper. I usually adjust my own back on a regular basis but for this I will most likely go get it adjusted.Vitki	 yours might be the same problem	 but I know from what you told me about your hands that you have arthritis and carpal tunnel in both of your wrist. For the arthritis dexterity exercises help	 but will most likely need meds for more relief. As for the carpal tunnel I suggest either surgery or wrist support for while you sleep. My carpal tunnel was brought on by me sleeping on my wrists	 so with the brace on at night	 my pain has almost gone completely away. I don't have the stiffness in my hands when I wake up anymore.callipyge	 yours sounds like the other one except for how it spreads to the rest of your body. I suggest that you get the adjustments from a chiropractor	 but also look into some holistic medicines. Should try some medicated teas with antioxidants. You probably should check into your Vitamin D. Your issue sounds like I originally explained	 but also with something else that makes it worse in your case.For all of you I suggest 1 to 2 hours a week of Yoga or Tai Chi. Both are excellent for self realignment of your bodies.Hope that helps if anyone has any questions feel free to ask. ***@**** put subject as Aches and Pains."	0

post_1572840	post_1558918	"Tums is usually recommended by my ob/gyn. If I remember correctly	 Tums does not have the aluminum while Rolaids does. The dr. also said Tums was good as a Ca suppliment."	0

My mother alerted me to stop drinking coffee -- at least stop drinking cup after cup.    Water would be better.    Hope this helps."	0
post_1572866	post_1558918	"Missy	Here's my two cents worth. My OBGYN allowed me to have either tums or maalox while pregnant. I have a hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease. It was really severe during pregnancy and I would get terrible pain. Of course always check with your doctor before trying anything at home	 but I found it helpful to prop up on several pillows instead of lying more flat on the bed. Try to eat your last meal or snack at least 2-3 hrs. before bedtime	 and stay away from caffeine. Sometimes ginger-ale and/or a saltine cracker would help me. Contrary to popular belief milk does not help heartburn	 it actually increases acid production in the stomach. Of course you and your baby need adequate milk	 calcium and magnesium but if your doctor allows itskim milk is less likely to affect you. If you are worried about the aluminum	 ex strength Tums does not list it in their ingredients. I am fairly certain though that Maalox does have it.Hope this helps but do check it out with your doctor. Good luck and hope you have a healthy baby!"	0
