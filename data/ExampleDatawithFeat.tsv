The risk of dealing with ""what they could get without the vaccines"" verses the risks of ""the side effects getting the vaccines"" was a chance I was willing to take.    I live in a very diverse and transient area with many people from other countries coming and going out of the US every day.    The immunization rules and regulations are not nearly as strict in other countries as in the US.    Many other countries are still dealing with many diseases that the US eradicated 20 or 30 years ago due to our immunization program.

For that reason	 we are seeking to speak with anyone who experienced serious Gardasil side effects.Gardasil has also been linked to an increased instance of fainting following administration of the vaccine.

In May 2007	 a 24-year-old woman suffered a miscarriage	 which an investigator in a report issued to the federal government said	 _  may have been caused by Gardasil because the patient received the injection within 30 days of the pregnancy._   In July 2007	 a 17-year-old girl from Texas was unaware she was pregnant when she got her second dose of Gardasil. She miscarried	 but the cause of the miscarriage hasn_  t been determined	 according to a report.The reasons for two other miscarriages    in Florida in 2007 - one by a 16-year-old and another by a 24-year-old both - are undetermined	 according to reports. But it is known that both women had Gardasil vaccinations shortly before the miscarriages.    If you or someone you know suffered a miscarriage following the administration of Gardasil	 it is important that you contact one of our Gardasil side effect lawyers in order to protect your rights.Most disturbing among the Gardasil side effect reports are those that involve the deaths of young women.    Three young women in the US died shortly after receiving Gardasil	 while two other women in Europe also died after the vaccine was administered.    Despite all of these reports	 Merck continues to market Gardasil as virtually side-effect free. Our Gardasil side effect lawyers believe that Merck has misled the public about Gardasil's potential dangers	 and our law firm intends to hold Merck accountable for these dangerous Gardasil side effects.Legal Help for Gardasil Side Effect VictimsIf you or someone you know suffered a serious Gardasil side effect	 you have valuable legal rights.

post_3665101	post_3665075	"Hi Steve	Titanium allergies are rare	 may be because people rarely come in contact with this metal on a regular basis; except for people who have them as implants. However it is unwise to jump to a conclusion that Titanium is the allergen without proper investigation. The first step would be to attempt to determine if any drugs that one is taking are causing this. Hypersensitivity reactions to titanium have been reported to be a cause of implant failure in hip replacement surgery and for spine (vertebral) stabilization.    Skin patch testing for metal hypersensitivity was strongly positive for titanium and nickel	 supporting the role of the titanium bioprosthesis in the development of DRESS syndrome.

This is a serious decision and any consideration of it should include consultation with an allergist/immunologist.

post_8710921	post_3665075	"Dr.Sylvester	 My sister had Back sugery in 2008	 Where she had a titanium cage and screws placed in her back. After sugery she was in more pain then she had been before. and shortly after she started having other systems	 like bad headaches	 hives that come and go with bad itching. also she has pain through out her body and at times feels like she is going to pass out	 She has been back to the doctor that preformed the sugery and told all this to him. And even asked him if she could be allergic to the metal he put in her back. He dismissed this idea. Being fifty years of age    and knowing her body	 she knows there is something wrong. So right away she has gone on a quest to try to figure out what is happening to her body. She has been to neurologists	 neurosurgeons	 orthopaedic specialists	 and allergists. To no avail... It seems no one wants to get involved when they find out that her back injury is an L & I case where the case has been closed. She has had to pay out of her pocket for them all and is more then willing but does wish she could find some help. When she went to the allergist and wanted a test to see if she is allergic to the metal they put in her back he told her he didn't have any titanium	 but he'd be willing to perform the test but she would have to get the titanium from the company that produced the device. So she tried to get it from the company and they told her that they only gave samples to Doctors. She went back to the allergist with this news	 he was unwilling to go through the extra steps to get the sample because he said it is virtually unheard of for someone to be allergic to titanium.... So we are asking if you could point us in some direction to find some kind of help? She often feels like what ever is going on    with her body will kill her if she doesn't get some kind of help figuring out what is going on!!!! HELPLESS in Seattle. Thank you.

I see from your profile that you live in the Deep South	 and there is a tick borne disease called STARI	 for Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness	 similar to Lyme.    If you can find a doctor who focuses on that	 maybe you will make some progress.    Even within Lyme	 it seems to me from what I read that the tests are very specific to a particular bacterium	 and so the tests (which aren't very sensitive anyway) won't pick up the 'wrong' bug.A very nice	 well-educated	 and highly experienced doctor told me that anyone who really has Lyme is 'near death'	 and that anyone who is NOT 'near death' by definition does NOT have Lyme.    That's a bit of strange logic ... like saying that someone with cancer doesn't really have cancer because he's not yet at death's door.    There is a lot of denial about Lyme and other diseases	 I think because doctors are now so schooled in looking at the test results instead of at the patient and the symptoms.So all that means	 don't give up.    Keep looking.    The internet is your friend	 and just keep looking and reading till you find the right doctor to pay attention and work through things with you.

I see from your profile that you live in the Deep South	 and there is a tick borne disease called STARI	 for Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness	 similar to Lyme.    If you can find a doctor who focuses on that	 maybe you will make some progress.    Even within Lyme	 it seems to me from what I read that the tests are very specific to a particular bacterium	 and so the tests (which aren't very sensitive anyway) won't pick up the 'wrong' bug.A very nice	 well-educated	 and highly experienced doctor told me that anyone who really has Lyme is 'near death'	 and that anyone who is NOT 'near death' by definition does NOT have Lyme.    That's a bit of strange logic ... like saying that someone with cancer doesn't really have cancer because he's not yet at death's door.    There is a lot of denial about Lyme and other diseases	 I think because doctors are now so schooled in looking at the test results instead of at the patient and the symptoms.So all that means	 don't give up.    Keep looking.    The internet is your friend	 and just keep looking and reading till you find the right doctor to pay attention and work through things with you.    Hang in there.I don't know about the leg and arm cramps after taking the Vit D	 that may be the side effects I was wondering about	 so thank you for the information.

There is no way you can put a large amount of Mercury	 along with other toxins and chemicals	 into a small child's body	 and not expect problems.The HepB shot that they give on the first day of birth also contains thimerasol	 and these babies are not at high risk. It us usually transmitted through intravenous drug use	 and sexual contact	 and can even wear off within 7 years. So not many babies would be at risk for this disease.

Well about a year later he started to be very larthgis and always complained of aches and pains	 he would wake up in the night screaming his legs hurt and his feet.    Dr after Dr said they were growing pains. Well my other two kids went thru tremendous growth spurts quickly and NEVER went thru this.

post_4416865	post_2080416	"Well	 I am sure you have it all taken care of by now but I thought that I will still give my advice for others that may have this same problem.I have dealt with ADD issues for my whole life and still have them as an adult. I also have been in contact with many children with severe ADD symptoms. So my advice is as follows:For school work:1. Children with ADD hate school. They will do anything to avoid doing homework because it is hard	 they don't get it	 and it takes a long time (people with ADD tend to take about twice as long to do the same work as someone without it)a. Keep in constant contact with the teachers. i.e. Have them sign an assignment notebook that the child wrote down their assignment in (in pen because they will surely erase the assignments in pencil after the teacher has signed it)	 or have the teacher send you a daily email with the assignments for the day.b. When studying	 mix it up. And mix it up often. People with ADD get bored very easily when doing things they are not interested in. Make flash cards	 have them read it out loud	 you read it out loud to them	 quiz them	 make homemade worksheets.c. Have an area set aside with NO distractions. Some students can study with music in the backround	 the TV on	 or with a view of the outside world	 but students with ADD can't handle that and still be productive. They already battle the distractions in their head about EVERYTHING else	 outside distractions should be minimal	 if not	 nonexistant.d.     Take lots of breaks. People with ADD get frusterated and a feeling of their ""brain being full"". Every 20 or 30 minutes let them get up for a few minutes and walk around.2. At homea. Structure! I can't express how important structure is. Everyday should be very close to the same. Study time	 dinner time	 bed time	 tv time...they should all be at the same time everyday. It reduces frustration and provides comfort in knowing what is going to happen and when. Behavior problems will decrease drastically once the child gets used to this one small step.b. Take everything away. Most parents give their children everything and take things away when they do things the parents don't approve of. In my experience this teaches children to find ways around it. (Don't get caught and nothing will happen). It teaches to hide poor behavior as opposed to showing off good behavior. By taking everything away from the beginning and allowing priveledges for studying	 or chores it gives a feeling of accomplishment and pride in what they have done. This is particularly helpful in kids with ADD since they have very low self esteem. Think about it	 you don't get cable if you don't go to work and make the money to pay for it. You earned your TV time.c. Provide immediate concequences for actions. For children with ADD a great one to try is physical activity. This helps relieve frustration	 burn off energy	 and also promotes physical activity. The amount should reflect the issue. For example	 your child back-talks you - 10 push ups	 your child takes TV time without earning it - 50 push ups	 your childs hits his kid sister	 100 jumping jacks. Do the same thing	 EVERYTIME.d.    Put it in writing. Put house rules in writing. That way	 there is no forgetting and no mistaking.Good Luck. I hope this advice works. Teaching children how to cope with ADD is something that will follow them their whole life. ADD doesn't go away but if you can learn how to deal with your individual problems you can overcome it!If anyone has any questions please feel free to contact me atbrandi.***@****Entitle it: ADD Posting"	0	post_4059106	0.0	"Hey Jenara!How strange that I have not been on medhealth for a while and then lo and behold I find you in the ADD area.

post_1986358	post_1984179	"Hi SimplyStar	 You're asking a very good question.    Food has a huge impact on how fast cancer cells grow.    Most curries have tumeric in them.    Turmeric is known to kill cancer cells.Also	 Indian yogic texts from thousands of years ago talk about Pranayama (breathing techniques).    These breathing techniques oxygenate body cells and in the process the oxygen kills cancer cells.

Most curries have tumeric in them.    Turmeric is known to kill cancer cells.Also	 Indian yogic texts from thousands of years ago talk about Pranayama (breathing techniques).    These breathing techniques oxygenate body cells and in the process the oxygen kills cancer cells.

post_1788693	post_1783288	"Wow...it is nice to see that your child was diagnosed so early.    Sounds like she has made great strides.    Early intervention is so important.    I have one main suggestion for you.    I am a behavior specialist who specializes in autism.    What you are experiencing with your daughter is common for children on the spectrum.    She is verbal which is nice.    They often speak in script or string nonsensical	 made-up words together.    This is their way of playing and experimenting with words and learning how to use them purposefully.    They often like the sounds of certain words and will say things just because it brings them pleasure.    This is not bad.    She will eventually become more competent in speech with time.    Encourage any and all attempts to communicate (verbal	 gestural	 pictures	 etc.).    However	 let me give you one important suggestion.Kids with autism	 even the ones who can speak very well	 have strong difficutly relating with others.    They have trouble with reciprocal interaction	 the give and take	 back and forth regulation of conversing.    They usually need to control the interaction.    Part of this difficutly is their strong lack of being able to read the subtle cues and nonverbal language in communication.     About 70% of our communicating is through nonverbal language (facial expressions	 body posture	 gestures	 fluctuations/intonation in voice	 pauses	 etc.)    We process this information subconsciously.    It allows us to read between the lines	 and read the perspective and intentions of the other person.    People with autism have great difficutly with nonverbal language and often cannot interact well with others because of that.     Normal children learn to communicate nonverbally before learning their first words.    They already learn to process and read nonverbal language before becoming fluent in speech.    Children with autism do not pick up that early milestone.     However	 you can teach your daughter to read nonverbal language by using less words.     Use alot of animated facial expressions and exaggerated gestures when communicating.     Focus on nonverbal language (exaggerating it) and only use words to augment the nonverbal.     This forces the child to reference your face and actions to read communication intent. It also helps the child to ""relate"" rather then just talk.     It is alot of fun	 and very beneficial for the child.    Speak less and say more with your actions and facial expressions.    Our families play fun interactive games with ""zip your lip"" and ""lose your words.""    They pick any daily event and both the parent and child have to do it together with using no words.    It is fun and forces the parent to learn to exaggerate their nonverbal language.    It also forces the child to learn how to read nonverbal language.Good Luck	Bill"	0	post_1785477	0.0	"You'll be doing fine if you focus your efforts on regular conversation with her at home.

He echoes things that you say	 you cannot have a conversation with him	 he doesn't have the desire to socialize with other children	 he will say a couple words like milk or juice	 he has no desire to be potty trained	 he throws tantrums pretty regularly	 he head butts you	 he mimics Thomas the Train DVD's that he watches and he will play with those trains all day.

Normal children learn to communicate nonverbally before learning their first words.    They already learn to process and read nonverbal language before becoming fluent in speech.    Children with autism do not pick up that early milestone.     However	 you can teach your daughter to read nonverbal language by using less words.     Use alot of animated facial expressions and exaggerated gestures when communicating.     Focus on nonverbal language (exaggerating it) and only use words to augment the nonverbal.     This forces the child to reference your face and actions to read communication intent. It also helps the child to ""relate"" rather then just talk.     It is alot of fun	 and very beneficial for the child.    Speak less and say more with your actions and facial expressions.    Our families play fun interactive games with ""zip your lip"" and ""lose your words.""    They pick any daily event and both the parent and child have to do it together with using no words.    It is fun and forces the parent to learn to exaggerate their nonverbal language.    It also forces the child to learn how to read nonverbal language.Good Luck	Bill"	0.5218002200126648	3	0.6437113285064697	2	0	0	2	0.0

I am almost certain he is autistic. He echoes things that you say	 you cannot have a conversation with him	 he doesn't have the desire to socialize with other children	 he will say a couple words like milk or juice	 he has no desire to be potty trained	 he throws tantrums pretty regularly	 he head butts you	 he mimics Thomas the Train DVD's that he watches and he will play with those trains all day. He also does not really have any defined facial expressions. He will view somethings out of the side of his eyes. On the flip side he knows colors and very high numbers plus the letters of the alphabet. I really do believe that his mother is in denial because people have said things to her but she still does not get him evaluated.

One side thinks the other side is off track and neither are willing to budge...I thought of this if it puts anything into perspective... There's no scientific basis that I know of... I have read about shots	 the process of injecting a foreign substance directly into the bloodstream causing an autoimmune response for animals and people succeptable genetically...Perhaps it is this autoimmune response that gets triggered by the shot	 thus triggering discomfort	 headaches and general malise...If someone was genetically autistic all of a sudden	 their autism shows up a lot worse because the toddler is cranky and not feeling well.    If they are autistic	 it will surface up as a lot of negative autistic behaviors... It's negative behaviors that send parents to see the psychos (psychologists/psychiatrists). After all who would be complaining if their child could rattle off 100 presidents before they knew how to tie their shoe?Because of this	 a lot more people are getting diagnosed with autism than would be normally without an autoimmine response.For the supporters of shots ""causing"" autism	 perhaps there is naturally a little bit of an autoimmune thing in many people	 but the trigger makes a full blown case...For those that notice unconventional treatment working maybe alleviating the autoimmune disorder is getting rid of most of the negative behaviors	 thus making their child not appear as autistic anymore.-----------My question is: if there was a full cure: Would it take away some of the good traits as well as the bad?

If they are autistic	 it will surface up as a lot of negative autistic behaviors... It's negative behaviors that send parents to see the psychos (psychologists/psychiatrists).

Go into the doctor now. I'm betting you'll have the same wonderful experience I did and they'll do a ekg and blood test and you'll more than likely come up as anemic.

post_16766	post_14715	"*continuing from what I previously said because it wouldn't let me finish the rest*Anyways	 I have three questions. 1. Does anxiety cause a burning sensation throughout your body? 2. Can regular blood tests tell if you have diabetes? I even was checked for billirubin *which is about the liver* and they told me everything was fine and I think your liver would be messed up if you had diabetes right? 3. Does anyone here that has anxiety attacks ever feel extremely weird and not real? I feel real but it just seems odd. Like I always think something is wrong with my head because I feel like im out of it but im not. Kinda misplaced feeling.

Here are a list of some things that have happened to me - pressure like air bubble in my head	 burning pains	 numbness	 popping noise in head and neck	 cant keep still	 feeling as though im in a dream all the time	 trembling	 heart palpatations	 dont feel like i want to do anything	 cant leave the house alone	 feeling like im about to die any second all the time!! chest pains	 confusion	 tinitus	 fear of going mad..............Anybody else have these really weird feelings in their head?"	0.4907361567020416	18	0.32343006134033203	17	0	0	17	0.0
post_3407296	post_14715	"For the past few months I have felt like something is seriously wrong with me. It started with muscle twitching in my arms that have since spread everywhere. I have also been experiencing nauseau	 no appetite	 fatigue	 insomnia	 muscle aches and pains	 and the past few days I have been getting this burning feeling in my body. I had it in my back the other night	 I could feel it more when I was laying down. Right now I have it in my head. It's a pretty scary feeling. I did not know what was wrong with me and made the mistake by looking it up online. I found that muscle twitching could be a sign of MS	 ALS	 and Parkinson's disease. That was all I needed to here. Now I worry constantly that I have one of these diseases. I went to my dr and he told me it was anxiety. I have also been waking up with racing heart and feeling like I can't breathe.

post_3468213	post_14715	just wondering if with everybodys anxiety do you have these feelings pretty much constantly or just every once and a while. i went to a neurologist for dizziness that has been here for 10 mths and he says that he thinks it is migraines but we are wondering if my anxiety is playing a big role. when you all have dizziness from anxiety how long does it last bc mine is a pretty constant thing being off balance all the time.	0	post_3407296	0.0	"For the past few months I have felt like something is seriously wrong with me.

post_3571908	post_14715	Wow I am really glad to read eveyone's comments on here...I actually got off my Zoloft about 2 moths ago and then all of a sudden started getting pain in my neck and back spreading down my arms and then to my legs I am getting cramps and tingling/burning.    I consider myself an expert health anxiety searcher and first had myself convinced due to the neck pain going down my arms that I had a tumor in my neck.    Then when the leg thing started I had myself convinced I had a blood clot.    Now I am having the burning all over and have researched so indepth that I have figured out that I must have a tumor called adenoma on my parathyroid gland causing my body not to absorb calcium and magnesium.    I have been taking supplements but the funny thing is doc already checked my thyroid...so dont know why I am trying to diagnose myself.    I am really glad everyone here has had the burning all over though cause that was my next search...I think I need to get back on the zoloft but I dont want to cause I lost 15 lbs getting off of it.    I know that sounds horrible but it makes me really fat and right now I am at 115 and 5'1 so it is so perfect!!Question does anyone else have the burning all day or is it just when your having an anxiety attack?Also I clench at night and I know alot of my neck and shoulder and headache symptoms are due to that just cant control my thoughts from thinking it is something worse.

I'll let you know what the doctor says.My pain is frequent but not continuous. It burns as though I've been bitten by a bee but when I look there's nothing there and it's extreme pain! :(    Thanks for sharing	 I'll keep in touch.

But now	 after reading these posts	 i don't feel alone.I have feelings of burning in both legs	 my sides and even my arms.    I am on Clonazepam for anziety.

post_5122234	post_14715	"Hello. I am a 27 year old female that has had anxiety and panic attacks for awhile now. I first went on zoloft back in 2002 and after about three weeks of continual meds	 I started to feel normal again. I then decided to take myself off of the zoloft because I did not like the thought of being on ""the happy pill"" or even depending on it to feel ""normal"" again. I lost my father in 2005 and dealt with a lot of stress and sadness at that time and had to go back on the zoloft. Again	 after a few weeks started to feel better so went off the medication	 which I have heard and read that that is a bad thing to do. It is now 2009 and almost a month ago I had a terrible spell of vertigo. I went to the doctor and she said that it was a sinus infection and that one of my ears needed to be cleaned	 which they did in the office with a water machine	 peroxide and a pick that shoots a steady stream of liquid for about 5 minutes or so. The doctor also asked how things were at home and at work. I told her that I have been stressed and that my BP was really high when the nurse checked it. She then put me on Toprol for my heart rate and BP	 zoloft (the generic brand) and Omnicef for the sinus infection. Now this appointment was on Fri Oct 30th	 and by that Monday night I woke up feeling anxious	 dry heaving	 and like my body was on fire. I went and woke up a family member and was scared	 crying	 felt like I was dying. It finally went away after about 15 minutes and after that episode I was exhausted. When I woke up I felt like I had been beaten. I then called my doctors office thinking that I had an allergic reaction to one of the meds or a combination of them but my doctor was out	 so I took an appointment with another doctor there and he didnt check anything. All he did was up the does of my bp meds and write a new script for a higher dose. I did not like that at all	 so I called another doctor	 an internal doctor and got an appointment. She checked me thoroughly and saw that my bp and heart rate were elevated so she took me off of everything and did a script for ativan until my blood work and urinalysis came back. A week later I went for a follow up and she placed me on a bp med that had a side effect of scalp tingling. I am really sensitive to meds apparently	 and I couldnt take it. She put me on another med and it seems to be good	 although I have to take it 3 times a day. She also	 put me back on the zoloft and I started to have adverse reactions. While I was out I had a horrible panic attack and had to leave the salon that I was at. I then had another that Sunday. Called the nurse and the doctor called back and told me to try paxil. Well	 I started yesterday and about 5 pm. I got up feeling anxious and started to have the on fire feeling	 sweating	 but yet my skin felt cold. My heart rate was through the roof	 so once I calmed down and stopped crying I took an ativan. My liver enzymes were elevated so I had an ultrasound done to that area this past Tuesday and it came back that I had a dense liver? Not sure what the next step is	 but I am not a smoker or drinker	 and wonder why me? My panic disorder is getting the best of me and I cant function away from home :(It seems as if all of the medication is having an adverse reaction and I dont know what to think. Any advice?

post_5747620	post_14715	"Hello everyone		 My name is Shan an i too have been living with anxiety and panic for a long time	 mine started when my mom and brother passed away and went through a divorce in between.. My mother died alone at home	 we found her in the bathroom floor and by brother died on the road in a horrible big truck accident. So naturally I took on the every little thing that happened to my body I was afraid I too was dying.    After many trips to the ER and being hospitalized I was diaganosed with a MVP. The doctor was great and explained to me that	 that itself can cause anxiety and panic attacks	 unfortuanantly I was not able to take the meds for that... so I go to my gp	 and I was over weight I had had a baby and still had not lost the weight and he explained to me that being overweight can cause this issue to so he put me on prozac	 xanax	 a diet pill and a diuretic.. so for the next few months I did not know if i was coming or going	 I would be out at three in the morning washing the car cleaning etc. I never slept.. and i was losing 15 pounds a week			 i got so small that i looked anorexic and still had panic attacks. so after a while i started taking more and more xanax and got really addicted to them to the point that i was taking a months supply in about a week and a half and then bumming off of other people that had them and going to the emergency room.. Finally once i was in a rage a went to the emergency room and they told me that if i took one more i would die and they were suprised i was still alive now. so i go to rehab and got put on Klonopine....when i came out of rehab i was pissed and decided i was not going to live this way anymore. so i started doing things that scarred me alone 				 until i realized hey i am still alive		 and one day they were gone and i have been panic free for ten years up until 2006. then they came back again. and here we go again			 this time it was my gall bladder and after they took out my gallbladder i was once again fine until 2009. My best friend and boyfriends step son passed away	 my job very stressful and my 18 yr old daughter became the nightmare from hell... i lost my hair and the whole nine yards				my symptoms are different this time 				 all the same old ones but new ones too				 like the hair loss	 the tremors	 and i shake upon waking now	 and it feels like my blood sugar is low and etc.    I too have done alot of research and i am sure that some of this u have already figured out		 but some illnesses and infection in the body can cause anxiety for people who r prone to it and fear or death can set them off and so can some meds	 like cold medicines and breathing treatments	 and inhalers etc.    but one day when i was having an episode in the store 		 this great lady that helped me explained alot too. like if u have had a surgery and u have scar tissue and it gets the nerves trapped in the scar tissue can cause it too	 and if ur body is out of alignment that can trigger it as well. so not really sure of what she told me 			 i was to the point of hey i will try anything except drugs 			 i wont do that again			 and i will be damned if after one visit to the chiro if i did not feel great... ur body can get out of alignment because of injurys or poor posture or scoliose	 etc	 and sometimes that make ur spine press on the nerves in a bad way				 and believe it or not ur nerves control alot of things	 so just a thought 	 also i heard accupuncture helps and like the rubber band issue	 when i feel an attack coming on instead of reaching for a pill i sit down and i write	 about everything that is bothering me and by the time i am done my panic attack is gone		and then i throw the paper away	also healthy snacking helps		 when u eat and ur body starts to digest it has something else to focus on for awhile like digestion 		 so i keep alot of fruit and nuts and beef jerky and pop corn on hand and it does not take much to throw ur body in digestion mode. so i hope it helps"	1	post_5705273	0.0	"For like a year now I have been experiencing all of these symptoms.

post_5774267	post_14715	"From what I read here I to believe I am having anxiety problems. From what I can remember it may have started late last year always worried about something. Something happen in the beginning of this year to where I had a fear of moving	 where am I going to live	 how am I going to pay rent and everything else like that. Well in May those fears came to reality with a eviction notice. Ever since then I have been worse then I have ever been in life. I could not sleep and if I did it was a few hours	 my insides where feeling all jittery	 I could not sit still	 I was feeling like I should of been doing something but there was nothing I could do	 I was not eating and ended up losing 10lbs in 2 weeks. I was in and out of a bath atleast 5 times a day for that helped me a little.	 before all this I was seeing a therepist but was really scared to call him for I did not want to end up in the hospital thinking that will just make matters worse. I was a wreck.Now for the present day	 my doctor put me on depression pills and that seems to help just a little. we are still facing the eviction and I still have the fears of where to go with my kids	 how to pay rent	 since right now I am living in a place where it is based on income	 and everything else. I have turned my life to god and my mind is a little bit more stable then it was however now I am experiencing something new. and that is the burning sensation. last night it was going across my chest and today it is in the upper part of my arms. I was woundering if anxiety could be playing a part in this that is when I came across this website and realized that something more is not wrong with me. I feel in my heart now that I need help in more ways then one.

Finally once i was in a rage a went to the emergency room and they told me that if i took one more i would die and they were suprised i was still alive now. so i go to rehab and got put on Klonopine....when i came out of rehab i was pissed and decided i was not going to live this way anymore. so i started doing things that scarred me alone 				 until i realized hey i am still alive		 and one day they were gone and i have been panic free for ten years up until 2006. then they came back again. and here we go again			 this time it was my gall bladder and after they took out my gallbladder i was once again fine until 2009. My best friend and boyfriends step son passed away	 my job very stressful and my 18 yr old daughter became the nightmare from hell... i lost my hair and the whole nine yards				my symptoms are different this time 				 all the same old ones but new ones too				 like the hair loss	 the tremors	 and i shake upon waking now	 and it feels like my blood sugar is low and etc.    I too have done alot of research and i am sure that some of this u have already figured out		 but some illnesses and infection in the body can cause anxiety for people who r prone to it and fear or death can set them off and so can some meds	 like cold medicines and breathing treatments	 and inhalers etc.    but one day when i was having an episode in the store 		 this great lady that helped me explained alot too. like if u have had a surgery and u have scar tissue and it gets the nerves trapped in the scar tissue can cause it too	 and if ur body is out of alignment that can trigger it as well. so not really sure of what she told me 			 i was to the point of hey i will try anything except drugs 			 i wont do that again			 and i will be damned if after one visit to the chiro if i did not feel great... ur body can get out of alignment because of injurys or poor posture or scoliose	 etc	 and sometimes that make ur spine press on the nerves in a bad way				 and believe it or not ur nerves control alot of things	 so just a thought 	 also i heard accupuncture helps and like the rubber band issue	 when i feel an attack coming on instead of reaching for a pill i sit down and i write	 about everything that is bothering me and by the time i am done my panic attack is gone		and then i throw the paper away	also healthy snacking helps		 when u eat and ur body starts to digest it has something else to focus on for awhile like digestion 		 so i keep alot of fruit and nuts and beef jerky and pop corn on hand and it does not take much to throw ur body in digestion mode. so i hope it helps"	0.678917407989502	66	0.6804413199424744	61	4	1	61	6.0606060606060606

From what I can remember it may have started late last year always worried about something. Something happen in the beginning of this year to where I had a fear of moving	 where am I going to live	 how am I going to pay rent and everything else like that. Well in May those fears came to reality with a eviction notice. Ever since then I have been worse then I have ever been in life. I could not sleep and if I did it was a few hours	 my insides where feeling all jittery	 I could not sit still	 I was feeling like I should of been doing something but there was nothing I could do	 I was not eating and ended up losing 10lbs in 2 weeks. I was in and out of a bath atleast 5 times a day for that helped me a little.	 before all this I was seeing a therepist but was really scared to call him for I did not want to end up in the hospital thinking that will just make matters worse. I was a wreck.Now for the present day	 my doctor put me on depression pills and that seems to help just a little. we are still facing the eviction and I still have the fears of where to go with my kids	 how to pay rent	 since right now I am living in a place where it is based on income	 and everything else. I have turned my life to god and my mind is a little bit more stable then it was however now I am experiencing something new. and that is the burning sensation. last night it was going across my chest and today it is in the upper part of my arms. I was woundering if anxiety could be playing a part in this that is when I came across this website and realized that something more is not wrong with me. I feel in my heart now that I need help in more ways then one. I Pray to god to make thing better."	0.5113306045532227	67	0.439264178276062	62	4	0	62	5.970149253731343

They all came back clear. Before being discharged the conversation always went back to anxiety depression and panic attacks. Well I have had several panic attacks and they are no fun. I have been taking xanax and paxil. I also had an upper edoscopy done yesterday and was told that I have minor erosion in my stomach and some other minor abnormalities still waiting for biopsy results to come back. I'm in major pain all over my body and the stress of the waiting period for the biopsy results has triggered several attacks. I have become very dull always want to be in bed and very short fused it has affected my family life and my wife doesn't know what else to do. I am so afraid of death that It has ruined my life . I just want my life back. Haven't been to work in over a month. I need some help. This is not fun at all.

You name it I have had it.    They all came back clear. Before being discharged the conversation always went back to anxiety depression and panic attacks. Well I have had several panic attacks and they are no fun. I have been taking xanax and paxil. I also had an upper edoscopy done yesterday and was told that I have minor erosion in my stomach and some other minor abnormalities still waiting for biopsy results to come back. I'm in major pain all over my body and the stress of the waiting period for the biopsy results has triggered several attacks. I have become very dull always want to be in bed and very short fused it has affected my family life and my wife doesn't know what else to do. I am so afraid of death that It has ruined my life . I just want my life back. Haven't been to work in over a month. I need some help. This is not fun at all. Looking forward to being a productive person in society like I use to be before this Hell I'm going through.	0.5905927419662476	79	0.6578028202056885	72	6	0	72	7.59493670886076

It seems like ages since I last had one and I'd forgotten how awful there are. For me the actual attack last seconds but the symptomsseem to last for weeks. 3 weeks on I still feel ill ... I have all the symptoms you guys are writing about ... the weird burining senstaion ... allover my back	 down my legs and arms. Headaches. Tight chest and feelings of being short of breath. My heart feel like its punding so hard ... and yetI feel so un fit. Before the attack I went on a 40 mile bike ride ... which I loved .... now I don't think I could cycle a mile. Palpitations too.It's weird how the symptoms seem to fluctuate from day to day. Generally the symptoms seem to last a month or so ... then I might get another attack.These symptoms seem quite bad this time ... but that might be due to the fact that I haven't had an attack in a while and my body isn't used tothem. I'm going to the gym this lunchtime .... the first time in 3 weeks ... I don't feel up to it but I'm going to force myself. I think theexercise will help. Perhaps try a bike ride at the weekend. I was on prozac for 15 years ... I found that helped a lot with the OCD/Anxiety. I cameoff it 18 months ago. I think I will resist going back on it for now and see how it goes. Its also funny how I feel so annoyed with myself abouthaving the attack in the first place ... I feel I could have done better at preventing it ... does anyone else get those feelings? ... it makesthe symptoms all the harder to bear as I feel I inflicted them on myself.

post_7439661	post_14715	Further to my Oct 18 post....It turned out that the reason I was burning up wasn't because of anxiety it was because I had pneumonia.It goes to show how awful and how many are the symptoms associated with anxiety that you can mistake pneumonia for it.I spent 5 days in hospital.I'm fairly sure the anxiety attacks are to blame for me getting it. The anxiety can lower your immune levels in time.Anyway ... I'm back at work now and still taking the 60mg prozac.I'm not sure if it's working yet ... still getting the anxiety attacks ... it's all a matter of trying to control them. The ones that come out of blue are the worst. They seem to get you off guard.You have to be strong ... take each day at a time.I'm having lots of thoughts of dying ... like I won't live long etc.I will not be beaten though. :>	0	post_7438042	0.0	"I can relate to that all I can say is read and apply the bible to your every day lives	 I was diangnosed with a chemical imbalance in my brain when I was about 18 years old (28 now)	 I over came that in God's will.

post_7475811	post_14715	These same things are going wrong with me the worst is the burning pain in my chest and the headaches.. I am only 22 and it freaks me out to the point that I think I'm dying... I have been to the hospital 3 times in the past month and each time they say nothing is wrong.. The only answer they give me is that my potassium is low and it has almost the same symptoms as an anxiety attack.. low potassium makes you have terrible mussel spasms.. and your heart is the biggest mussel in the body.. the chest pain hurts so bad that I cry at times.. but I am going through a pretty bad time right now and am very stressed out with financial and relationship problems.. I'm glad im not the only one having these problems but I just wish it would stop..	0	post_7439661	0.0	Further to my Oct 18 post....It turned out that the reason I was burning up wasn't because of anxiety it was because I had pneumonia.It goes to show how awful and how many are the symptoms associated with anxiety that you can mistake pneumonia for it.I spent 5 days in hospital.I'm fairly sure the anxiety attacks are to blame for me getting it.

My dad has stomach cancer that can't be operated on and the doctor believes Chemo/radiotion isn't going to have any effect.My dad also read the www.Cancer-Prevention.net article and we will try Vitamin B17 and Cellular Zeolite.

It is basically an allergy to profilin ( a birch pollen protein) but it is most obvious as an allergy to all non-citrus tree-borne fruit	 the whole parsley family (carrots	 celery	 parsley	 chives	 fennel	 dill)	 and    lots of ""sensitivity groups"" which can include many other groups like tropical fruit.    I'm curious because also being allergic to the mint family (includes basil and oregano	 alas)	 I have found that many toothpastes contain xylitol which can be derived from either corn or birch.    I have only found 1 or 2 toothpastes that don't contain this.    Thanks."	0.45758068561553955	26	0.7264794707298279	25	0	0	25	0.0

I'm super sensitive to vapors.... but I do get light headed	 etc when I consume anything that has that minty taste!Oh worst shopping mistake.... mistaking normal peas for the mint flavored ones -_-"	0.5707586407661438	69	0.5070837736129761	65	3	0	65	4.3478260869565215

However	 the side effects of Amitriptyline are too scary. One of them is that it can make the symptoms worse.That's the reason I was looking for alternatives.I can understand your skepticism about the doctor who specializes in alternative medicine	 but if you have health care that ***** like the one in my country	 he is the one that most likely can diagnose your illness	 instead of constantly prescribring Paracetamol for all your symptoms.

In 1990 the FDA banned all Tryptophan containing products from the market after an outbreak of a blood disease EMS. Tryptophan contained impurities that made it unsafe for consumption.It has been remarketed and sold as 5-HTP as a supplement in order to get around the FDA ban. It still will work for the same people that L-Tryptophan worked for. It is sold as an herbal supplement or ""natural alternative"" only because it cannot gain FDA approval. It is no more natural than any other antidepressant. It still contains the impurities. It still could make some people sick.It might work for you. You could always try it.I wouldn't fool myself into thinking it's ""safer"" or ""more natural"" though.It's a perscription medication that worked for many people and was rejected for making people sick. If it doesn't work	 don't feel bad about seeing a Dr that can prescribe something FDA approved. There are some wonderful medications out there."	0.4582698345184326	3	0.5024853944778442	1	1	1	1	33.33333333333333

However it is not a cheap medicine	 at least in my country.I've been prescribred Amitriptyline for my symptoms by my regular doctor	 and it seems to be working well. However	 the side effects of Amitriptyline are too scary. One of them is that it can make the symptoms worse.That's the reason I was looking for alternatives.I can understand your skepticism about the doctor who specializes in alternative medicine	 but if you have health care that ***** like the one in my country	 he is the one that most likely can diagnose your illness	 instead of constantly prescribring Paracetamol for all your symptoms.

The impurity led directly to a health problem	 a condition with a flu-like syndrome called Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) which cause some 1500 incidents in the United States	 including 38 deaths. The FDA quite rightly removed tryptophan from the market on the 17th of November	 1989 and banned its distribution. The source of the health problem was quite quickly identified	 and the production operation was changed back to the original process	 and the tryptophan product was again available free of any toxic impurity. This freedom from any impurity was acknowledged by the FDA	 but they transferred the toxic aspect of the substance from the impurity contained within it (now no longer present) to the substance itself. The implied declaration was that tryptophan was intrinsically toxic.The sale of tryptophan as dietary supplements for man is now illegal. Dietary supplements to animal stock feed is OK. Tryptophan is available to hospitals for use in critical situations. Tryptophan is available as a prescription drug. But it is not available in the health food stores and so cannot be explored by the lay researcher. The world of inquiring into the action on normals	 schizophrenics	 alcoholics	 people who are overweight	 people who are depressed	 is denied both to the private individual and to the clinical researcher. There are commercially available drugs	 all approved	 that can play the same role. Within four days of the announced ban of tryptophan (after the problem had been resolved and corrected) a broad promotion of Prozac (an antidepressant similar in action to Tryptophan) appeared in Newsweek (March 26	 1990). Prozac is still widely promoted. Tryptophan is still not available to the private individual. Both can play the role of being an effective sedative.A quotation from the FDA Dietary Supplement Task Force Report	 page 2	 June 15	 1993	 deserves careful reading.""The [FDA] Task Force considered various issues in its deliberations	 including ... what steps are necessary to ensure that the existence of dietary supplements on the market does not act as a disincentive for drug development.""What are dietary supplements?

post_2559911	post_15004	"I've done considerable lay research on this topic	 so here's what I can offer.First	 you may have inherited naturally overactive apocrine sweat glands in your underarms. Apocrine secretions are odorless	 but when naturally-present microbes feed off these secretions	 they release a malodorous metabolic byproduct. What compounds the problem is your anxiety	 which creates a feedback loop resulting in increased perspiration	 higher localized skin temperature	 greater smell	 and on and on. The end result is the perfect storm for odor	 as microbes love warm	 humid areas	 and you have conditioned yourself to be hypersensitive to peoples' negative evaluations.First	 consider getting a prescription antiperspirant. These are about 4 to 5 times stronger than the off-the-shelf type.Second	 start doing guided imagery/meditation/yoga *twice* daily	 which will slowly retrain your sympathetic nervous system not to overreact to stressors.

Hope this helps!Cori"	0	post_2559911	1.0	"I've done considerable lay research on this topic	 so here's what I can offer.First	 you may have inherited naturally overactive apocrine sweat glands in your underarms. Apocrine secretions are odorless	 but when naturally-present microbes feed off these secretions	 they release a malodorous metabolic byproduct. What compounds the problem is your anxiety	 which creates a feedback loop resulting in increased perspiration	 higher localized skin temperature	 greater smell	 and on and on. The end result is the perfect storm for odor	 as microbes love warm	 humid areas	 and you have conditioned yourself to be hypersensitive to peoples' negative evaluations.First	 consider getting a prescription antiperspirant. These are about 4 to 5 times stronger than the off-the-shelf type.Second	 start doing guided imagery/meditation/yoga *twice* daily	 which will slowly retrain your sympathetic nervous system not to overreact to stressors. Doing this twice daily (20 minutes each) is important.Third	 you need in-vivo exposure therapy--basically	 a therapist or friend who can help you face stressful environments without you freaking out.

I overheard people at work talking about my smell	 people I thought were close friends and I wanted to never face them again.    i struggle to look at them now as I know they're thinking that I don't wash or wear clean clothes but that's not true.When I use the high strength anti-persp they make me itchy down below which I think is sweat related.    I asked my asthma nurse if the meds could cause it	 she laughed and said she'd never heard that one.    No-one wants to know and I can't turn to anyone as I think I'd lose their respect.

I was convinced that i had body odor all day	 every day after small amounts of sweating. It would only take me overhearing someone mention the words like ""smell	 stink	 odor	 etc"" that would send me into a reclusive	 introverted state. I assumed everyone thought i smelled. This anxiety only caused me to sweat more. I am by nature an extremly outgoing	 and friendly person. However	 anyone (outside of immediate family) who knew me back in the day would have told you i was a loner	 loser	 and very strange.Currently	 i own a business with 45 employees	 which requires me to be very up close and personal with people on a daily basis.Let me say this.....I have no idea to what extent or severity of an odor that my body produces when i sweat. All i can say	 is that now that i have conquered the fear of smelling	 whatever smell i project doesnt seem to bother anyone as bad as i thought.I think our minds start to go into warp speed when it comes to this disorder. Thats right	 i said disorder.This is how i got over it.......I went on vacation to the beach for a week when i was 18.

Where before	 a yard space between me and a person felt like inches	 i suddenlu didnt care anymore. I left that trip with the conclusion that most of this body odor thing was in my mind. Sure	 i may have had body odor	 that is totally possible. I still to this day dont know if it was all in my head	 or if my body put off a distinct odor when i got nervous. All i know is	 the way you handle this disorder is contageous.What i mean is...... If you continue to accept the fact that you smell	 and that this smell offends everyone	 you will continually get worse.However	 if you can find it inside of you somewhere	 just to let go	 and not care	 if even for a weekend	 i think that you will find that the results will be contageous in a positive way.Sorry for the novel	 but i just wanted to offer some encouragement.

I cut back on spices like cumin	 curry and garlic.I shave and/or wax all body hair.    I started using antibacterial liquid soap to shower.And most important	 BEFORE applying anti-perspirant/deodorant I spread a thin film of Neosporin or any triple antibiotic on both armpits	 small of the back	and private parts. Worked like a charm. I still get a lil nervous about people getting to close to me	 but I KNOW I don't reek or smell bad anymore. Hope this helps and works for you!"	0.46876201033592224	32	0.5170667171478271	24	7	1	24	21.875

post_8193679	post_15004	"Hey everyone	I'm 33 yrs old and I am also one who falls victim to this. I'm writing ehre in hopes that someone will read it and shed some light in my situation. Although I have not yet been clinically diagnosed I get anxious around people because of a fear that i smell. My best of friends try to reassure me that I don't but I'm lead to think one of two things. 1) they're hiding the truth from me	 2) they're used to my smell. How could I think this way with my friends?For about two years now when I'm around strangers I've been paying attention to the way people react after they look at me when standing close enough. I get more reactions to pay attention to when I speak. As some mention here	 there are the varieties of touching their nose. What gets me most is when people actually say stuff like ""smells like bathroom in here"" or ""what's that god awful smell?"" when i'm just 2-5 feet away. As people approach me in as I stand in crowded areas	 I'll notice people look right at me as if they can tell even in a sea of people that i'm the culprit of a nearby odor. Like many here I shower every morning before I leave the house and once more before I go to bed. The people I ask continue to tell me they don't smell anything. Yet the other reactions I watch out for continue.""It's all in the mind"" my friends insist. And after reading your comments I realized something that's been playing in my mind -- that there's a vicious circle with anxiety of B.O and B.O. itself. If anxiety triggers B.O. and bad odor is what you're concerned with in social situations	 you're bound to have it. The only way to avoid it is to not think about it	 right?I definitely try not to think about it sometimes and most of the time I'm successful. Friends reassurance + shower / brush teeth before I leave the house have me thinking there's nothing to worry about and anything I notice should be coincidence and warrant no explanations. I'm a man of many artistic talents so I really have a lot to be confident about. I'm even a lead singer of a band. We're great. People love us. Unfortunately still	 my walls get chipped at the sight of every nose twitch and my world turns upside-down the second someone says ""what's that smell?""I exercise regularly so i know it's not that. I don't drink alcohol often. My diet is quite good and consistent. I can only get stronger by continuing to not care what people think but sometimes I can't help it.

post_2379563	post_2379005	"Here's the deal: trypto	 found in poultry	 cheese	 and as a purified drug in finer department stores everywhere	 acts to help your body produce more seratonin	 which is a kind of ""brain juice"" that may induce or support a calmer feeling about things. It also helps you make niacin	 of all things. You can google it and get all the details	 just as you've done.But what you need to keep in mind is that	 as an amino acid	 it is in competition with everything else to get plugged into your bodily processes. And that is why the actual delivery of the stuff from a turkey sub of Thanksgiving dinner may not be all it is cracked up to be.The pros are that it might work.

It also helps you make niacin	 of all things. You can google it and get all the details	 just as you've done.But what you need to keep in mind is that	 as an amino acid	 it is in competition with everything else to get plugged into your bodily processes. And that is why the actual delivery of the stuff from a turkey sub of Thanksgiving dinner may not be all it is cracked up to be.The pros are that it might work. The cons are you won't know if it was the trypto or something else	 and it could hurt you	 maybe.Spend the lousy $75 and run it by someone with a professional medical background like an actual doctor. Whether good news or bad	 at least you'll know it is from someone who has reason to actually know what he's talking about.

post_5110500	post_3026105	"Wrinkles on your fingertips	 can be caused from sweating fingers. Before I sprayed my Pc mouse with 9 coats of Clear Lacquer to cover the plastic	 my plastic allergy	 ""although mild allergy compare to the other synthetics"" this mild allergy to the plastic caused the mouse to make my finger tips and palm to sweat. And the sweating so much	 for me being on the PC so long all the time	 made my fingers get wrinkled at the tips. Same theory as being in the bath tub too long. Only instead of water it is sweat. Key here would be fingers are wet too long.I also got some tingling. However	 even though I usually itch when touching an allergen like plastic or polyester	 my fingers have a heavy skin for I am a man and have tough hands. But anyways	 my thumb sweat the most from this and the skin on it got a big spot that blistered and peeled	 over and over.So the only input I can give here is excessive hand sweating	 and/or prolonged sweating is causing this. Sweating at the point of an allergen contact is one symptom of this ACD condition.But to say that is what is making this happen to you people is to guess.So ask yourself	 Do my hands sweat while holding the mouse. And is the sweating from the plastic or just from holding the hand and fingers on a non absorbing surface	 which would maybe make them sweat. And then ask yourself	 ""Do my hands sweat that much or at all when I hold other things which are non absorbent? And ""do they sweat with absorbent things I hold	 leaving this surface of ""whatever I am hold"" damp or wet from sweat?""If the answer to that is no	 or only other synthetics like polyester	 vinyl	 plastics. then the answer becomes clearer.Ask yourself also ""Do my feet sweat a lot when I wear colored socks? Because this happens to people and not for the color. The body doesn't sweat from colors. It sweats because colored socks are polyester or have plenty in them. All cotton colored socks fade and get pilly. And white socks are mostly cotton or at least 80% cotton	 and absorb what little sweat 2-20% polyester makes one sweat.Or do your feet sweat or itch a lot from the shoes? These are reactions that come and go. But one thing is for sure folks. Plastic allergy is very real. Although mild for most compared to other synthetics	 or higher quality plastics.This condition I have is called Allergic contact dermatitis. Defined as a delayed reaction from contact with an allergen. However the sweating in not delayed	 or at least fairly quick compared to the rashes	 redness	 swelling	 and other syptoms(symptoms).I hope this shed some light for you. Consider it	 but do not stop your quest here.Masking tape over the mouse helps me too. That is what I did before spraying it to see. And it helped for the most part. However some does go through the tape. You have to cut the gaps between the bottons	 and around them with a razor so it funtions okay. Also note that the wheel being a synthetic may do the same thing to you if you use it. So don't during testing. And if this it it	 then you have a mild allergy to plastic.Thus you can clear coat with a non allergen which is very hard to block out allergen. But it bleeds into the clearcoat if it is not fast drying. So use Lacquer	 For those properties. And 9 thin coats will be enough!Hint: I have done this clear coat to my keyboard	 mouse	 telephone	 desk top surface	 and every other hard synthetic in my house that I have to touch. As well as vinyl				 well you get the point.Please report back! :)"	1	post_5109822	0.0	"I have the same thing happening small creases covering the palmns of my hands and occasional numbness and tingling	 It has been driving me crazy!!

And white socks are mostly cotton or at least 80% cotton	 and absorb what little sweat 2-20% polyester makes one sweat.Or do your feet sweat or itch a lot from the shoes? These are reactions that come and go. But one thing is for sure folks. Plastic allergy is very real. Although mild for most compared to other synthetics	 or higher quality plastics.This condition I have is called Allergic contact dermatitis. Defined as a delayed reaction from contact with an allergen. However the sweating in not delayed	 or at least fairly quick compared to the rashes	 redness	 swelling	 and other syptoms(symptoms).I hope this shed some light for you. Consider it	 but do not stop your quest here.Masking tape over the mouse helps me too. That is what I did before spraying it to see. And it helped for the most part. However some does go through the tape. You have to cut the gaps between the bottons	 and around them with a razor so it funtions okay. Also note that the wheel being a synthetic may do the same thing to you if you use it. So don't during testing. And if this it it	 then you have a mild allergy to plastic.Thus you can clear coat with a non allergen which is very hard to block out allergen. But it bleeds into the clearcoat if it is not fast drying. So use Lacquer	 For those properties. And 9 thin coats will be enough!Hint: I have done this clear coat to my keyboard	 mouse	 telephone	 desk top surface	 and every other hard synthetic in my house that I have to touch. As well as vinyl				 well you get the point.Please report back! :)"	0.2978349030017853	21	0.3828044533729553	18	2	1	18	9.523809523809524

Maybe it can be a neurological disorder in which the body's hormones send the wrong signals throughout the neurons. The pores will be filled with fluids in the thickest part of the skin. My possible cure for it	 3 minute water exposures every 2 hours. Avoid heavy oils such as hand sanitizers because they clog up the pores even more. Then again	 what do i know?"	0.4961227774620056	41	0.5995762348175049	37	3	1	37	7.317073170731707

I honestly think this is a form of sensory nerve damage	 most likely from a vitamin/mineral deficiency.    I think it seems likely as well as many people on here are women who said symptoms were worse when breastfeeding	 as it is common to lose nutrients during this process.    I think the most important thing is to keep your head	 remember to laugh (as this helps the parasympathetic nervous system) and see a good naturopathic doctor. It seems clear from this forum that most doctors will just guess and give a synthetic band aid.    I think what we all need is to support each other	 and give ours bodies the tools it needs to heal	 in the form of a healthy diet full of vitamins and minerals.    I have been going through health issues recently and this is just another thing that is stressing me out	 but I realized... that stress is probably the worst thing for it.    Try to stay positive and remember not to go to the worst case scenario	 as it is easy to do on the internet	 as everything is a symptom of everything it feels like at times.    Our modern life styles are very taxing	 so I think rest	 positivity and nutrition will be our best tools to heal ourselves.    Remember	 this is what the body does best	 it just needs the right tools	 and often it takes time.    My biggest test to learn patience and positivity...    hopefully we all can.    Good luck to us all	 and lots of love.Ryan"	0.37936657667160034	61	0.2989487051963806	53	7	2	53	11.475409836065573
post_6439819	post_3026105	Has anyone figured this out yet?    I have had the same exact symptoms - sensitive wrinkled fingertips for about a week now.    I had this condition about a year ago and went to see my doctor who had no idea - it went away on it's own after a month or so.    Now it's back and it is very irritating!    I'm afraid to go back to the doctor because I'm assuming she will be clueless again.Interesting note although it doesn't appear that everyone on this post is female so I don't believe it is related - I am currently breastfeeding and had my 2nd c-section earlier this year.

Eat something heavy in Wheat flour and watch what happens.Cut out the wheat flour and you will see the hands repair.orB) Some of you could be looking at development of diabetes.Most doctors do not study after Med school...

post_8022536	post_3026105	"Interesting and very long thread - a bit frustrating for a slow reader like me but interesting nonetheless. Yes I have all the same symptoms. Started a year ago with small and painful splits and wrinkles brought on by what I thought was from weeding the garden with bare hands	 usually in the mornings when the plants are wet. I thought I might have picked up a fungus or something. Live a healthy life	 no medical issues	 take omega 3 and saw palmetto supplements	 60 yr. male. Exposure to water seemed to definitely exacerbate the wrinkling. Bag Balm worked marvelously to heal the splits but never got rid of it. Diaper rash ointment (zinc oxide) seemed to work a bit but it turns the skin around my gold wedding ring black. Tried changing my diet by stopping certain foods like tea	 coffee	 vitamins but all to no effect.My sister claimed she had it and it stopped when she and her family went on a gluten free diet for her daughter who has celiac disease. While camping in damp weather I it got real bad. Didn't have have cold hands though. I tried a gazillion different things and finally what worked best so far - at times almost perfect hands is: first to disinfect your hands with hand sanitizer. Then apply O'Keeffe's Working Hands cream available at TSC in Canada and possibly Tractor Supply Co. in USA. Also available from Lee Valley Tools by mail order. And I then sprinkle on extra strength Gold Bond power (zinc oxide 5% and menthol 0.8%). I do this definitely before going to bed and in the morning all looks great. Badger Balm also works but not quite as well and smells nice. So based on this the topical disease ie fungus or bacteria might be an explanation also.I think that it also could be symptomatic of emotional stress in general. I know that the tingling is a symptom of that for sure. My stress levels have been high lately	 ie I have also been getting panic attacks lately which is very weird. So I should change my lifestyle and remove stressors from my life. I'll also try a gluten free diet. I will also start watching the BPA -- Bisphenol A used to make hard plastics -- contact and will try the Burt's Bees Soap. Saw that at Lee Valley too.

I thought I might have picked up a fungus or something. Live a healthy life	 no medical issues	 take omega 3 and saw palmetto supplements	 60 yr. male. Exposure to water seemed to definitely exacerbate the wrinkling. Bag Balm worked marvelously to heal the splits but never got rid of it. Diaper rash ointment (zinc oxide) seemed to work a bit but it turns the skin around my gold wedding ring black. Tried changing my diet by stopping certain foods like tea	 coffee	 vitamins but all to no effect.My sister claimed she had it and it stopped when she and her family went on a gluten free diet for her daughter who has celiac disease. While camping in damp weather I it got real bad. Didn't have have cold hands though. I tried a gazillion different things and finally what worked best so far - at times almost perfect hands is: first to disinfect your hands with hand sanitizer. Then apply O'Keeffe's Working Hands cream available at TSC in Canada and possibly Tractor Supply Co. in USA. Also available from Lee Valley Tools by mail order. And I then sprinkle on extra strength Gold Bond power (zinc oxide 5% and menthol 0.8%). I do this definitely before going to bed and in the morning all looks great. Badger Balm also works but not quite as well and smells nice. So based on this the topical disease ie fungus or bacteria might be an explanation also.I think that it also could be symptomatic of emotional stress in general. I know that the tingling is a symptom of that for sure. My stress levels have been high lately	 ie I have also been getting panic attacks lately which is very weird. So I should change my lifestyle and remove stressors from my life. I'll also try a gluten free diet. I will also start watching the BPA -- Bisphenol A used to make hard plastics -- contact and will try the Burt's Bees Soap. Saw that at Lee Valley too. Thanks for the info guys.If I find anything else useful I will gladly share."	0.5174291133880615	114	0.5948002934455872	101	12	1	101	10.526315789473683

post_2084687	post_2046707	"Hi.    It is not clear to me what the results of your mother's ER/PR and HER-2 assays are	 so I can't give a definite answer to your question if she's going to have difficulties with her medication.    What I'm going    to do is explain a little about those tests.The ER/PR assay measures the amount of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in cancer cells.    The implication is that cancer cells with high levels of ER and PR are susceptible to hormonal treatment aimed at opposing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on those cells.    Conversely	 cancer cells with low ER/PR levels grow independently of estrogen stimulation	 and therefore would be resistant to the effects of hormonal treatment.    Because of this resistance	 tumors with low ER/PR levels may have a poorer outcome than those with high levels.HER-2 is a receptor found on the surface of breast cancer cells. It accepts stimulatory growth signals from a substance called epidermal growth factor.    The HER-2 assay measures the amount of HER-2 on the surface of cancer cells.    Tumors with high levels of HER-2 are usually more aggressive than HER-2 negative types and they may be resistant to certain kinds of chemotherapy.    HER-2 positive cancers    may have a poorer outcome compared to those that are negative for this test. Fortunately	 there is already a drug in the market called trastuzumab which specifically targets this type of breast cancer.If your mother is ER/PR negative and HER-2 positive	 she may have difficulty with certain medication in the sense that her tumor would have resistance to hormonal treatment and certain types of chemotherapy.    But this does not mean that it is not possible for her to get effective treatment.    Newer chemotherapeutic agents	 together with trastuzumab have been proven to be very effective against this type of breast cancer."	0					1	0.6465848088264465	0	0	999	0	0.0

Instead of killing people with their toxic chemotheraphy and breaking peoples systems down then sending them home to die...its cruel.    Chemo is designed to give people hope that their doctors know what is right. Here are some statistics by two prominent Professors one an Oncologist	 the other a Radiologist.http://www.laetrile.com.au/otherpages/chemo1.htm--------------------where to purchase cellular zeolite online :-http://www.zeolitedirect.com/zeolite-products.phpCancer Strategy #1: Use Zeolite To Kill Cancer Cells...Without Harming Your BodyChemotherapy and radiation therapy tries to kill the cancerous cells. Unfortunately	 they often harm your body in the process. There are natural supplements that do a good job of killing cancerous cells	 but don't cause harm to your body. A few supplements do have potential to be toxic to the body	 and should probably just be used in conjunction with a naturopath or alternative doctor. These include cesium	 artemisia	 and B17. In this report you will learn only about completely safe cancer supplements that can be used with no supervision.You may well ask why 	 if a safe and natural product is able to kill cancer	 doesn't your doctor recommend it. Of course	 he probably doesn't know about it	 but even if he did	 he's not likely to use it.It's the nature of the medical/drug industry. Doctors use and recommend drugs that are approved in a process that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The drug companies only make drugs that can be patented. That way they can sell them for huge mark-ups and have no competition.Lady00712/10/07ALL    Did you know that CAT SCANS are equivalent to 400 chest xrays in Radiation.Did you know that TAXOL kills veins and cripples the area where its been administered....Did you know that HERCEPTIN 2 gives your cardiotoxidity...weakens your HEART...TAXOL combined with HER2 Govt approved only if you take HER2 WITH TAXOL...wow    That sounds like blackmail..Their aim is to kill you one way or the other.Lady00712/10/07ALL    After feeling three lumps in my left breast last december 2006.    They did a mamogram(mammogram)on the breast and you could see the lumps quiet clear.    I then went on to have the biopsy which was via Ultra sound visual system by which you could see the lumps quiet clear again.    These lumps turned out to be grade 3 Cancer	 which had infected two lympnodes.     I then had surgery after nuclear dye had been administered to keep the Doc on track when removing my breast and finding all the supposed infected areas. The surgeon took 15 lympnodes plus the sentinal gland in this operation along with the whole breast removal.    It was the ongoing treatment that had me rather bewildered as to the system of which followed.    I was hit with AC x 4 Cyclophosphamide	 Amend	 Granistron	 Hydrochlorid	 and    Dexamethasone [sent my sugar levels sky high spent week in hospital with that] with maxalon to stabalize my system and diabetic 2 medications.    This was only in the first 4 treatments at 3 week intervals.    Then HER2 combined with TAXOL another 4 treatments...Now I am down onto HER2 on its own...My heart rate first up was 38% next 42% next 47% the next test is pending.    I have decided that if the heart does not come up over 50% next test that my treatment should be stopped.    I need an opinion here?Lady00712/10/07ALL    To my way of thinking my breast should have been hit with radiation to shrink the cancer berfore surgery was administered.    Thus giving a more direct approach to the cancer via the surgeon.    Then when the wound was healed I should have been hit again with radiation.

post_3499796	post_3491832	Thanks.    I spoke to a friend of mine yesterday who is an oncologist in our area and she said that avastin will probably not be an option any more because my mother had a pulmonary embolism in the hospital.    We'll find out on Friday when we meet with the oncolocgist.    She said that they will not usually give avastin any time after someone has a pulmonary embolism.It looks like carbo/taxol will be it.    We will keep our fingers crossed her cancer responds to it.Have you ever heard if iv vitamin C and B17 are effective?	0	post_3494789	0.0	My doctor and others have said they won't give carbo/taxol/avastin because it's not a protocol yet --- I think you have to go through the trials unless you can find someone willing to try on their own --- they still don't know for sure that the triplet works better than the pair(carbo/taxol)	0.3777850270271301	2	0.3777850270271301	1	0	0	1	0.0

post_2251393	post_2244054	"Thanks for the input folks. I was thinking maybe (too obvious??) that since the thyroid is part of the auto immune system that maybe my immune system was just in shock or something	 but maybe that is not right? I mean	 I know that a surgery of any kind suppresses your immune system	 and causes your whole body to weaken	 but I was just grasping for something.I came out of the surgery well	 no complications	 got right back to the gym working out	 eating well and so forth. Right off the bat i started getting sick alot. I have gone on sort of a cycle of being well for a week or so and sick for 2 weeks then well	 then sick	 and so on.I also babysit a little guy	 he is 7 mos old now and I have watched him since he was a newborn. He has been sick a lot as well.........seems like we pass this cold/sinus gunk back and forth to each other too. It is weird.So	 now I am thinking maybe (when I feel well again) I need to do a thourough gut cleaning on our house? Talking scrubbing down with bleach or disinfectant cleaners... stripping all the beds and bleaching sheets	 wiping down doorknobs	 lightswitches	 telephones... all that stuff. I hate to be    a total freak but I cannot keep getting sick like this. I am soooo tired of it. :O(Overall I feel pretty good	 even with my TSH jumping up so high like it has	 so the only thing holding me down is that I keep getting sick all the time.Right now I take several meds and teas. I drink at least 2 cups of green tea per day	 I drink my 10-12 glasses of water faithfully	 then I take my Levothyroxine 150 	 Vit E	 blood pressure meds and a multi vitamin (every other day) and I have been taking a Vit C booster drink but not everyday. I guess when I go back to the Dr I will talk to him about doing something more?I keep thinking of going to a naturapathic Dr here in town	 to see what she might reccomend in the way of vitamins but I know tha they are so outrageously expensive and my insurance does not cover most of that kind of thing. Also	 I eat a pretty well balanced diet and I know that most vitamin supplements just go through you without absorbtion if your body does not need the added nutrients. So..... then what to think? I don't want to throw away good money - you know?Anyway	 thanks for the advice and input.Darla"	1	post_2249488	0.0	"I have not even had a sniffle since my TT on Dec 12th of 06.Ive radically altered my diet but my superfood smoothies in the morning are the driving force of my health right now....i use several superfood powders in my smoothies such as green vibrance	living fuel	constant health and my favorite private reserve super food by jon barron...i also throw in some organic yogurt	grounf flaxseeds and flaxoil.grapes.banana	organic berries(specifically red raspberries and blueberries	cayenne peper	vitamin c powder	rice protein powder	honey	cinamon	chlorella	ground aprikot seeds for b17	almond or coconut milk and 4 ozs of either grape	acai.or pomegranate juice....im also really into herbal teas now..specifically sir jason winters herbal teas.....he is a miracle cancer survivor...very interesting story...anyhow hope this helps..i cant go one day without my superfood smoothieRoman"	0.4619753360748291	7	0.679792582988739	5	1	0	5	14.285714285714285

post_4582355	post_4576175	"Much that I have read about MS indicates that MSers typically do have sleep issues involving both	 diminished quality and quantity of sleep.    In other words	 sleep issues are to be expected in people with MS.I had a sleep study done:    Now I'm on CPAP (for obstructive sleep apnea) which helped me for about a year and a half	 but now I'm starting to have some bad nights again.    I have an adjustable bed and sleep best in a sitting position.My sleep doctor emphasized that preparation for sleep should begin about two hours before bedtime.    You should dim the lights then	 don't go out in any sunlight	 and generally start chilling out.    Too many people go from action to sleep time - thinking they can just turn off all the stimulation and go to sleep immediately.    It usually won't work that way.    Don't watch a stimulating TV show or read a chapter book that leaves you hanging in suspense.Also my sleep MD emphasized that there should not be any recreational items such as a computer or a TV in your bedroom.    Your bedroom should ONLY be associated with sleep.    No treadmills	 no exercise bikes	 no desk piled high with bills should be in your bedroom.    Only your bed and related furniture so your body associates that room with sleep!!    Also	 you should have total darkness when going to sleep - either by blackout drapes or some kind of comfortable sleep mask.You should go to bed and get up at essentially the same times every day.Hope the above helps you.    I agree a sleep study could be good for you - with sleep apnea	 no matter how many hours you sleep	 you almost never feel rested.WAF"	0	post_4582301	0.0	"I've tried those alternatives	 but nothing helped much. the tossing and turning	 difficulty to get comfortable	 and sometimes those mild type spinal tremors	 or whatever we call them invade my sleep time. i have to have a loud fan on due to the ear ringing and that helps.i finally had to go and get some meds to take once in awhile for sleep	 after years of not taking meds and	 suffering by not taking them	 i now take them and they help	 especially with sleep. i wouldn't mind trying ambien but never asked the doctor about it.one other really frustrating thing is that somedays i almost passout from fatigue	 at least that is the feeling/sensation	 but when i get to a place to lay down	 i can't sleep naturally. i take a med or two then.i have cracked(LOL) before or at least i should say i've won the Mr Irritable award.

My belly button has a really bad odor and it hurts to touch on the inside. Right now it has been inflamed its really red inside and hurts to touch around it like when I wear my jeans. Mine has been like this ever since I remember. I has always hurt to touch inside but never has been as red or as sore on the outside.

post_2652341	post_117452	"hello guys	i have just read everyone's entries and like all yourselves	 i suffer from the awful smell and gunk from the belly button.i am an overweight 21 year old and my belly fat rolls up so the belly button doesn't get any air to it and makes it damp and moist and very smelly.i used to have a belly button piercing but took it out after 2 months cos my body rejected it and now the hole has closed up but there is a huge red rash and scab above it and sore red thrush-like symptoms around the inner belly button. it itches and is very sore.i went to the doctors and was diagnosed with fungal infection and they prescribed me an antifungal cream called daktacort (you can purchase on internet 15g for  __5).the cream has helped immensely.to avoid the smell coming back	 shower daily and always clean the belly button out and make sure you dry it properly.also try sprinkling some 'mycil powder' around the hole to stop it from sweating. normal talcum powder is fine but because mycil powder treats athlete's foot and fungal infection	 it could be the better option to get rid of nasty infections and odors.

post_2653952	post_117452	"For years on and off my belly button has smelled.    I do have a ring	 but even before I got it it smelled sometimes... I think the solution is simple... MAKE SURE YOUR BELLY BUTTON IS DRY BEFORE putting clothes on.    I started to really pay attention to what was happening when my belly button was smelly...

( __3 from chemist for large tube).hope this helps!kim"	0.626936674118042	37	0.6536773443222046	32	4	1	32	10.81081081081081

I DO NOT STICK ANYTHING IN TO MAKE SURE IT'S DRY.Within a few days (one week max)	 this is sure to clear up any problems (unless they are more serious).    It's the best way I've found to combat recurring belly button infections	 and it makes sense that it works.

post_3403938	post_117452	"I think that like any other ailment	 the stinky belly button can be caused not only by one	 but several factors.    The main problem is having a deep belly button	 or one that gets little air (due to being overweight or other such factors as tight unbreatheable clothing).    Yeast	 fungus	 and anaerobic bacteria are all possible causes	 depending on the person.    Anaerobic bacteria thrive in spaces with little or no oxygen.    Yeast and fungus like moist environments.    People with deep belly buttons or ones that have a lot of fat or clothing covering their belly buttons have a higher chance of harboring the organisms.    Unless you can get a culture	 it's hard to pinpoint what organism is causing your belly button distress. If you do find out what organism is in there	 you can then treat it accordingly	 i.e.	 antibiotics	 yogurt	 etc.    Another thing that helps harbor those organisms is when your immune system becomes compromised somehow	 i.e.	 due to stress	 medication	 or other illness	 it is not able to fend off the ""bad"" organisms as well	 so they can easily proliferate on your body.    Also	 a change in the body's pH	 even slightly	 can help the microbes to grow.    This may be the case for those of you who experience the stinkiness around the time of your period	 as your body's pH changes slightly.    It's also possible for stinky belly buttons to be caused by an umbilical hernia	 cysts	 or other cuts/abrasions in the hole.

I couldn't believe this. I tried EVERYTHING from alcohol to peroxide to powders	 to scrubbing that hole raw with a Q-tip. Nothing worked. As you know	 the smell is embarrassing...I poured a capful of Tea Tree Oil	 which is also an antiseptic cleanser	 into my navel	 let it marinade for a few minutes	 wipe with cotton ball or Q-tip	 and the stench dissappeared. It hasn't reappeared yet	 and thats been almost 5 Months. Thank you Lordy !!!!!!! Wish I had known about this 15 Years ago...    Hope this also works for You.!!!!"	0.43159642815589905	88	0.4708913564682007	73	14	1	73	15.909090909090908

I used an anti fungal cream	 I'm in the UK so I used Canesten 1% Cream (normally used for nappy rash	 I'm not sure what the equivalent outside the UK would be). I would also use talcum powder to keep it dry. I used the cream 3 times a day	 each time I applied it I also put talcum power lightly over the top to help keep it dry.

I used an anti fungal cream	 I'm in the UK so I used Canesten 1% Cream (normally used for nappy rash	 I'm not sure what the equivalent outside the UK would be). I would also use talcum powder to keep it dry. I used the cream 3 times a day	 each time I applied it I also put talcum power lightly over the top to help keep it dry. And made extra care to dry it properly after showering or exercising. Even though after 2 week all signs of infection had gone	 I carried on treating it for an extra week as I searched for info and a lot of sites said that the infection can stay around even though it looks like it's gone.

post_5544555	post_117452	"For many people	 the belly button is the focal point of their bodies. Your midsection is constantly exposed in summer when you are at the pool or beach. Not only is there pressure to have a nicely toned midsection	 it can be embarrassing if you are emitting a foul odor from your belly button. Some people even get a dark	 whitish	 or clear discharge from their belly button.There are a few conditions that can cause belly button discharge. Patent urachus or a urachal cyst are a couple reasons why you could have belly button discharge. Sometimes people get debris caught inside the belly button. The debris inside the belly button can cause irritation of the skin and lead to an infection. On some people	 an abscess can form and cause a foul-smelling odor. The smell is bacteria that do not use oxygen and produce the foul odors. Your body will send white blood cells to the infection to fight it off and control the infection from worsening. Your doctor may need to perform surgery and prescribe antibiotics if the infection worsens. The infection may also be a yeast infection in the belly button.Patent urachusA surgery called patent urachus will be performed to correct a urachus tube that fails to close after birth. The urachus tube is a small tube that connects the fecal bladder to the umbilical cord. Patent urachus repair is a surgery to close a defect of the bladder. When a baby grows inside the womb	 the urachus will normally close. If the urachus fails to close	 you need to have a surgery performed to close it. Having an abnormal opening between the bladder and the area where the umbilical cord was removed	 will increase the risk for bladder infections.This condition is more common in females than in males. The discharge that drains out of the belly button is actually urine. Surgery for patent urachus will require several days in the hospital. Generally recovery from patent urachus is quick and most people do not experience reoccurring problems. Patent urachus may heal on its own in about two months	 but you will need to watch it closely so it does not get infected. There have been rare cases where it does not heal and it presents a problem later in life. If patent urachus does not heal and reoccurs later in life	 it can reappear as swelling and discharging urine or mucus from a cyst.You may also experience inflamed lumps around the belly button. These lumps that form may cause persistent infection in the individual and it leads to cysts and other things. If you think you have belly button discharge	 you should collect a sample for the doctor to perform laboratory testing on. Your doctor will take a swab of the mucus or liquid when you get to their office and send it away for testing.Urachal cystA urachal cyst is a cyst occurring in a persistent portion of the urachus. It is a large infection that presents itself as a large mass in the umbilical region. If you have a urachal cyst	 you will experience abdominal pain and a fever if it becomes infected. If it bursts	 the fluid will drain through the belly button. A urachal cyst is a rare condition that affects 1 in 2	000 people.In order to treat a urachal cyst	 you need a doctor to lance it. Bactine or hydrogen peroxide will then need to be applied to the cyst several times a day. Use antibacterial soap to cleanse the urachal cyst in the shower.Yeast InfectionSome people who experience belly button discharge may have a yeast infection. A yeast infection is simply an overgrowth of fungus. During a yeast infection	 you may experience painful itching and burning. A yeast infection can be treated with antifungal creams. Some people may need to have a prescription for a yeast infection. There are also home remedies for yeast infections. You can apply plain yogurt to the yeast infection and it will reduce the painful itching you may experience.If your child has a yeast infection on their belly button	 you need to speak with their pediatrician about treatment options. Many children cannot have antifungal creams applied to their stomachs as it may cause further irritation.A yeast infection will cause the belly button to become inflamed and red. It will itch and burn and you will get the urge to scratch. Resist the urge to scratch	 as this only worsens the condition. Instead	 use a cold compress on the belly button area to reduce your need to scratch. Ointments are another great way to reduce the burning and itching sensation of a yeast infection.If you have been treating the yeast infection for at least 7 days and you still are not getting relief	 you need to speak with your doctor. If your yeast infection was properly treated and then returned within 2 months	 you need to speak with a medical professional.ThrushThrush can also occur on the belly button and in the mouth after birth. Thrush is white patches in the mouth and on the tongue. Thrush can appear on other places of the body	 like the belly button. Thrush is a yeast called candida that grows out of control. Thrush usually occurs in babies because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight off the growth of yeast. Elderly individuals also experience thrush as their immune system begins to deteriorate.Thrush looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Generally it looks like you should be able to wipe these patches of whiteness away	 but you can't. You should not attempt to wipe the patches away	 as this will only cause further irritation and make the patches red and sore. A doctor can tell if your baby has thrush by looking at the white patches. For adults	 your doctor may discuss further medical information with you. Your family history will be talked about as it could be linked to something else such as diabetes.Thrush is normally not serious and can be treated with antifungal medicine such as nystatin liquid. You simply put the medication on the white patches and over time they will cease. For a baby with thrush	 they may also develop a diaper rash at the same time. Use some diaper ointment to reduce the rash at the same time you are treating their thrush. Some babies may need nystatin cream for their diaper rash. For an adult	 you will use medicine that is applied directly onto the white patches using a liquid dropper or lozenge. If the nystatin cream doesn't work	 then your doctor may need to prescribe an antifungal pill."	0	post_5462528	0.0	"Holy Wow! Thank you God!

You should not attempt to wipe the patches away	 as this will only cause further irritation and make the patches red and sore. A doctor can tell if your baby has thrush by looking at the white patches. For adults	 your doctor may discuss further medical information with you. Your family history will be talked about as it could be linked to something else such as diabetes.Thrush is normally not serious and can be treated with antifungal medicine such as nystatin liquid. You simply put the medication on the white patches and over time they will cease. For a baby with thrush	 they may also develop a diaper rash at the same time. Use some diaper ointment to reduce the rash at the same time you are treating their thrush. Some babies may need nystatin cream for their diaper rash. For an adult	 you will use medicine that is applied directly onto the white patches using a liquid dropper or lozenge. If the nystatin cream doesn't work	 then your doctor may need to prescribe an antifungal pill."	0.31093907356262207	120	0.3707900643348694	102	17	0	102	14.166666666666666

post_6137829	post_117452	**Try Lotrimin AF - it's a powder antifungal spray.    It worked for me!!!!What's interesting is we all have different forms of belly button odor issues.    Some people experience pain with it which I did not. (If you have pain please go see the doctor!)    Some have dark gook etc... I initially contibuted mine back to 2 laperoscopy surgeries (where they go in thru the belly button) then I thought could it be the extra 15 pounds I've put on over the past few years - hard to say.    Mine is not really an innie or an outtie it's just about even with the rest of my stomach.    I started getting daily almost whitish/yellowish crustiness in my belly button that had just a nasty rancid odor (like dead fish) that I could not get rid of.    The are was also irritated and pink.    I tried the peroxide treatment - no luck it just stung.    After reading everyones insights I decided to try a combo treatment.    Lotrimin makes a anti-fungal spray that has a powder in it (also used for jock itch). Within about 2-3 days I was feeling 100 % better. Every so often I will still hit it with the spray just to keep it from coming back. :-)    Seems to me though for anyone who has lumps in the belly button or infection colored discharge whether it be dark (ie: redish/brownish or anything that is oozy I would highly recommend a doctors opinion.    Just remember they've seen it all (and then some). It's not worth years of embarassment when it can most likely be resolved with a simple antibiotic treatment or for me and antifungal spray.

When this happens I usually put baby powder in my belly button to dry out the gross discharge and to mask the smell a bit and then powder again as many times as needed during the day until I can shower again."	0.5667219161987305	141	0.49997255206108093	123	17	0	123	12.056737588652481

Are u literally drying out your belly button because if not	 yes u can get thrush and other infections from yeast. It has to be totally dried off in there just like in between each toe and the crack of your a**. Athletes foot or miconazole should get rid of it and once its gone	 keep it very clean and VERY dry!! Even placing baby powder is better than nothing but again if U use powder IT MUST BE TOTALLY DRY!!!! Best Blessings."	0.2910537123680115	142	0.25097426772117615	124	17	0	124	11.971830985915492

post_7685465	post_117452	"I'm posting this comment high up the list because my bf had the same thing happening to him	 and after doing a lot of research I found out what it was and how to fix it for good. The cause of the smell is actually from a fungus	 not bacteria	 that invaded the opening of your belly button and is trying to continue spreading down your navel passage. So all the anti-bacterial stuff people do to try and fix it is ineffective	 including taking oral antibiotics which can even make it worse. Too much moisture around the opening is only half the problem for most folks: Take fewer showers (and quit swimming for awhile if that's what you tend to do)	 dry your belly button well	 swab it with alchohol	 and let it dry totally each time. Don't rub the area much at all while washing: you want it to heal itself shut! Keep your belly button as moisture-free as possible at all times to prevent giving the fungus a place to grow. Apply a topical antifungal of your choice to the area at least once a day until symptoms clear. Other than that	 dryness is key! ((I know this sounds icky	 but if you're starting out with ""goo"" in there	 it's best to squeeze it out before beginning treatment.)) That's what you do on the outside. Now for the inside of you:If you tend to love your: coffee	 alcohol	 ibuprofen	 sugar	 stress	 and 'wolfing' your food	 I have bad news. All of these things	 in addition to having insufficient digestive enzymes (evidenced by acid reflux	 etc.)	 actually contribute to your stinky belly button problem; you have to cut back on all of these things significantly in order to heal. These things contribute to a condition called Leaky Gut Syndrome	 in which the yeasts in your digestive tract (natural fungus) run rampant and cause mild inflammation of the small intestine. This inflammation results in porosity of the gut lining	 allowing microbes and even small food particles to leak out of the intestine and into the abdominal cavity. If this Candida yeast gets into your naval tract...viola! Stinky belly button. Soooo....You have to heal your small intestine in order to avoid your belly button problem from recurring. Trust me	 this worked wonders for my bf. Here's how: For two weeks	 avoid the stuff I mentioned just above. Add as much lemon	 lime	 garlic	 ginger	 and vegetables to your diet during this time as you can (it's a good habit to stay in). Chew all your meals and snacks slowly	 limit your portion sizes	 and take digestive enzymes with each meal (usually available in chews). Take probiotics daily (like what's found in live-culture yogurt or in pill form) for the two weeks. Probiotics are naturally found in the intestine	 but get overwhelmed by overgrowth of Candida; you got to replace 'em to put things back in balance. You will also daily want to take an amino acid called glutamine that is fairly tasteless and can be mixed into drinks. Glutamine helps heal your digestive tract so it's important to take it. Take omega-3 fatty acids or eat foods high in them. Staying hydrated and keeping up on your fiber will help flush out the fungus as it dies.If you follow this regimen for two weeks	 then keep up your healthy eating habits	 you will likely never see this problem pop up again. Best of luck!"	1	post_7671797	0.0	I get it too!!! Thankyou everyone.glad im not alone!When I was born I had an umbilical hernia and am convinced its to do with detaching!

post_7685577	post_117452	"Well	 I guess my comment didn't post very high up! Anyway	 I just wanted to add a couple of points: Some good external antifungals to try are tea tree oil	 grapefruit seed extract (called GSE)	 Monistat 7 if you have it around	 coconut oil	 apple cider vinegar	 oregano oil	 and clove oil.The particles that escape a leaky gut can cause other health problems such as fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites)	 allergies	 and asthma. When these particles are in the abdomen	 your body's immune system kicks into high gear to rid itself of the foreign object. It's something to consider if you are having immune-related problems or a large gut that doesn't seem to be all fat.Candida yeast is the same as thrush. It's what gives us vaginal yeast infections	 stinky belly buttons	 and that white coating on your tongue. It's favorite food is the sugars we eat and it can get out of control in the body with a high-sugar diet. Other factors that favor yeast growth in our bodies are: chlorine	 flouride	 heavy metals	 antibiotics	 nicotine	 food and beauty chemicals	 having diabetes or AIDS	 and eating processed foods from moldy sources	 like tomato sauce/paste/ketchup and dehydrated potatoes.Some good sources of omega-3: grass fed beef	 walnuts	 oily fish	 cantaloupe	 flax	 safflower oil	 fortified eggs and milk.If you are looking for more healthy foods to steer toward	 try grapefruit	 green apples	 quinoa	 buckwheat	 avocado	 whole grains	 tree nuts	 raw foods	 fermented foods (kim chi	 saurkraut	 kombucha	 tempe)	 yogurt	 and cruciferous veges like brocolli	 kale	 cauliflower	 brussels sprouts	 etc. Steer clear of packaged and fast foods as much as possible and cut back on white starches like potatoes	 rice	 pasta	 corn	 and bread.I hope all this helps someone...it took weeks of research to find the answer for my bf. He went to the doctor for his stinky bellybutton before I met him; the doctor's approach was to surgically remove his bellybutton. When the infection came back	 the same doctor cut out his entire naval passage. I met him several years later and the saw the infection come back again. The doctor wanted to do another surgery. I urged my bf to let me try to help him instead of going under the knife again. After following my recommendations based on what I found out	 he has not had the infection since and avoided a third sugery.

So all the anti-bacterial stuff people do to try and fix it is ineffective	 including taking oral antibiotics which can even make it worse. Too much moisture around the opening is only half the problem for most folks: Take fewer showers (and quit swimming for awhile if that's what you tend to do)	 dry your belly button well	 swab it with alchohol	 and let it dry totally each time. Don't rub the area much at all while washing: you want it to heal itself shut! Keep your belly button as moisture-free as possible at all times to prevent giving the fungus a place to grow. Apply a topical antifungal of your choice to the area at least once a day until symptoms clear. Other than that	 dryness is key! ((I know this sounds icky	 but if you're starting out with ""goo"" in there	 it's best to squeeze it out before beginning treatment.)) That's what you do on the outside. Now for the inside of you:If you tend to love your: coffee	 alcohol	 ibuprofen	 sugar	 stress	 and 'wolfing' your food	 I have bad news. All of these things	 in addition to having insufficient digestive enzymes (evidenced by acid reflux	 etc.)	 actually contribute to your stinky belly button problem; you have to cut back on all of these things significantly in order to heal. These things contribute to a condition called Leaky Gut Syndrome	 in which the yeasts in your digestive tract (natural fungus) run rampant and cause mild inflammation of the small intestine. This inflammation results in porosity of the gut lining	 allowing microbes and even small food particles to leak out of the intestine and into the abdominal cavity. If this Candida yeast gets into your naval tract...viola! Stinky belly button. Soooo....You have to heal your small intestine in order to avoid your belly button problem from recurring. Trust me	 this worked wonders for my bf. Here's how: For two weeks	 avoid the stuff I mentioned just above. Add as much lemon	 lime	 garlic	 ginger	 and vegetables to your diet during this time as you can (it's a good habit to stay in). Chew all your meals and snacks slowly	 limit your portion sizes	 and take digestive enzymes with each meal (usually available in chews). Take probiotics daily (like what's found in live-culture yogurt or in pill form) for the two weeks. Probiotics are naturally found in the intestine	 but get overwhelmed by overgrowth of Candida; you got to replace 'em to put things back in balance. You will also daily want to take an amino acid called glutamine that is fairly tasteless and can be mixed into drinks. Glutamine helps heal your digestive tract so it's important to take it. Take omega-3 fatty acids or eat foods high in them. Staying hydrated and keeping up on your fiber will help flush out the fungus as it dies.If you follow this regimen for two weeks	 then keep up your healthy eating habits	 you will likely never see this problem pop up again. Best of luck!"	0.7077503204345703	162	0.5536237955093384	138	23	1	138	14.19753086419753
post_7685588	post_117452	"Last thing: stinky belly button infection can happen from any perforation of the naval tract. Surgeries	 piercings	 and cleaning/picking the navel are possible culprits. My bf had picked out the tiny	 white keratin plug that naturally seals shut the navel opening. That's how his got started."	0	post_7685577	1.0	"Well	 I guess my comment didn't post very high up! Anyway	 I just wanted to add a couple of points: Some good external antifungals to try are tea tree oil	 grapefruit seed extract (called GSE)	 Monistat 7 if you have it around	 coconut oil	 apple cider vinegar	 oregano oil	 and clove oil.The particles that escape a leaky gut can cause other health problems such as fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites)	 allergies	 and asthma. When these particles are in the abdomen	 your body's immune system kicks into high gear to rid itself of the foreign object. It's something to consider if you are having immune-related problems or a large gut that doesn't seem to be all fat.Candida yeast is the same as thrush. It's what gives us vaginal yeast infections	 stinky belly buttons	 and that white coating on your tongue. It's favorite food is the sugars we eat and it can get out of control in the body with a high-sugar diet. Other factors that favor yeast growth in our bodies are: chlorine	 flouride	 heavy metals	 antibiotics	 nicotine	 food and beauty chemicals	 having diabetes or AIDS	 and eating processed foods from moldy sources	 like tomato sauce/paste/ketchup and dehydrated potatoes.Some good sources of omega-3: grass fed beef	 walnuts	 oily fish	 cantaloupe	 flax	 safflower oil	 fortified eggs and milk.If you are looking for more healthy foods to steer toward	 try grapefruit	 green apples	 quinoa	 buckwheat	 avocado	 whole grains	 tree nuts	 raw foods	 fermented foods (kim chi	 saurkraut	 kombucha	 tempe)	 yogurt	 and cruciferous veges like brocolli	 kale	 cauliflower	 brussels sprouts	 etc. Steer clear of packaged and fast foods as much as possible and cut back on white starches like potatoes	 rice	 pasta	 corn	 and bread.I hope all this helps someone...it took weeks of research to find the answer for my bf. He went to the doctor for his stinky bellybutton before I met him; the doctor's approach was to surgically remove his bellybutton. When the infection came back	 the same doctor cut out his entire naval passage. I met him several years later and the saw the infection come back again. The doctor wanted to do another surgery. I urged my bf to let me try to help him instead of going under the knife again. After following my recommendations based on what I found out	 he has not had the infection since and avoided a third sugery. I'm so mad at that doctor for perfoming unneccessary surgeries on my guy!!"	0.4760379195213318	163	0.5086928009986877	139	23	2	139	14.11042944785276

Instead of killing people with their toxic chemotheraphy and breaking peoples systems down then sending them home to die...its cruel.    Chemo is designed to give people hope that their doctors know what is right. Here are some statistics by two prominent Professors one an Oncologist	 the other a Radiologist.http://www.laetrile.com.au/otherpages/chemo1.htm--------------------where to purchase cellular zeolite online :-http://www.zeolitedirect.com/zeolite-products.phpCancer Strategy #1: Use Zeolite To Kill Cancer Cells...Without Harming Your BodyChemotherapy and radiation therapy tries to kill the cancerous cells. Unfortunately	 they often harm your body in the process. There are natural supplements that do a good job of killing cancerous cells	 but don't cause harm to your body. A few supplements do have potential to be toxic to the body	 and should probably just be used in conjunction with a naturopath or alternative doctor. These include cesium	 artemisia	 and B17. In this report you will learn only about completely safe cancer supplements that can be used with no supervision.You may well ask why 	 if a safe and natural product is able to kill cancer	 doesn't your doctor recommend it. Of course	 he probably doesn't know about it	 but even if he did	 he's not likely to use it.It's the nature of the medical/drug industry. Doctors use and recommend drugs that are approved in a process that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The drug companies only make drugs that can be patented. That way they can sell them for huge mark-ups and have no competition.Lady00712/10/07ALL    Did you know that CAT SCANS are equivalent to 400 chest xrays in Radiation.Did you know that TAXOL kills veins and cripples the area where its been administered....Did you know that HERCEPTIN 2 gives your cardiotoxidity...weakens your HEART...TAXOL combined with HER2 Govt approved only if you take HER2 WITH TAXOL...wow    That sounds like blackmail..Their aim is to kill you one way or the other.Lady00712/10/07ALL    After feeling three lumps in my left breast last december 2006.    They did a mamogram(mammogram)on the breast and you could see the lumps quiet clear.    I then went on to have the biopsy which was via Ultra sound visual system by which you could see the lumps quiet clear again.    These lumps turned out to be grade 3 Cancer	 which had infected two lympnodes.     I then had surgery after nuclear dye had been administered to keep the Doc on track when removing my breast and finding all the supposed infected areas. The surgeon took 15 lympnodes plus the sentinal gland in this operation along with the whole breast removal.    It was the ongoing treatment that had me rather bewildered as to the system of which followed.    I was hit with AC x 4 Cyclophosphamide	 Amend	 Granistron	 Hydrochlorid	 and    Dexamethasone [sent my sugar levels sky high spent week in hospital with that] with maxalon to stabalize my system and diabetic 2 medications.    This was only in the first 4 treatments at 3 week intervals.    Then HER2 combined with TAXOL another 4 treatments...Now I am down onto HER2 on its own...My heart rate first up was 38% next 42% next 47% the next test is pending.    I have decided that if the heart does not come up over 50% next test that my treatment should be stopped.    I need an opinion here?Lady00712/10/07ALL    To my way of thinking my breast should have been hit with radiation to shrink the cancer berfore surgery was administered.    Thus giving a more direct approach to the cancer via the surgeon.    Then when the wound was healed I should have been hit again with radiation.    Then to complete the process of doses of HER2 on its own....In my opinion...too many mistakes have been made on this problem with not enough thought gone into it...I also need an opionion here?Lady00712/11/07ALL    http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/doctoring1.htmlCORRUPT PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.    They pay big money to keep us sick with medicines	 that in the long term kill us.Lady00712/11/07ALL    THE THINGS DOCTORS DONT TELL YOU ABOUT HER2http://www.breastcancer.org/research_herceptin.htmlHerceptin with chemotherapyIn the other studies	 women with metastatic disease got even better results when they took Herceptin together with the chemotherapy drugs Taxol or Adriamycin (chemical name: doxorubicin) plus Cytoxan (chemical name: cyclophosphamide). These drug combinations shrank the tumors of nearly half the women (45%) treated. In contrast	 less than one third (29%) of those women who received chemotherapy alone had a similar response. When Herceptin was added to the chemotherapy	 it boosted survival by an average of 5 months compared to chemotherapy alone.A small number of the women taking the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin had significant heart problems	 including congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump effectively. Adriamycin was blamed for most of this effect. Herceptin on its own rarely causes heart damage. But the two drugs given together resulted in more heart damage than expected. For this reason	 the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin is no longer recommended.Navelbine chemotherapy combined with Herceptin has also been studied recently in clinical trials.----------------------------------------------Serious heart side effectsResearch News:Preliminary results from the HERA Trial: Herceptin Taken Less Frequently at Higher Doses Does Not Increase Risk of Heart Damage Less commonly	 Herceptin can damage the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Find out more about the benefits and side effects of Herceptin. Rarely (about 5% of the time)	 the heart damage is bad enough that women experience stroke or life-threatening congestive heart failure_  À_a condition in which the heart can't pump effectively. Slightly more often (about 7% of the time)	 Herceptin causes mild heart failure.Women who experience mild or more serious heart damage can stop taking Herceptin and start taking heart-strengthening medications. This often brings heart function back to normal.While heart damage can be more severe when Herceptin is given along with other chemotherapy drugs known to cause heart damage	 including Adriamycin (chemical name: doxorubicin) and possibly other drugs like it.Taking Herceptin with the chemotherapy drug Taxol (chemical name: paclitaxel) does not increase your risk of severe heart damage. Studies have shown that this combination causes only slightly more mild heart damage than Herceptin alone. Women in clinical trials who are receiving Herceptin plus Taxol are being watched very closely for this effect.Testing your heart before and during Herceptin treatmentBefore starting Herceptin therapy	 you should have an echocardiogram or a MUGA scan to check how well your heart is functioning.An echocardiogram uses sound waves to take detailed pictures of the heart as it pumps blood. For this quick test	 you lie still for a few minutes while a device that gives off sound waves is briefly placed on your ribs	 over your heart.

post_1883179	post_1784719	"Hi ladies.    I was just faced with this dilema the other day.    My DD turned one and we went in for her check up and routine blood work up for lead and aneamia	 which by they way was torturous!!	 anyway	 I asked as I always do	 what shots she would be getting that day.First off let me start first by saying that I NEVER allow her to get more than 2 at a time and thankfully I found a dr that totally agreed with that	 but I digress.    Anyway my point is and I do have one	 is that she was supposed to ger her MMR shot that day and I opted not to have her gt it.My reasons are this..it is NOT a life threatening disease so therefore why pump her with more chemicals than necessary.    I feel the same way about the chicken pox shot which sh will not be getting either.    First it wears off over time and I would rather her get them as a child than as an adult when it could be extremely dangerous.So my dr really did not give me a hard time and made me sign a waiver and said that I could change my mind.    I think vaccines are good because the mor we stop vaccinating the more these diseases have a chance of gaining ground again and we certainly don't want to be living in the middle ages.    I'm hoping this will not be an issue when she goes to school.IF thre is a connection for autism and I doubt there is but they haven't many ideas so they are creating things to divert from the fact that they just don't know	 I think it's a predisposition for some kind of a reaction.If I had known more about the shots when she was first born she would not have gotten the series of Hep B either."	1	post_1875030	0.0	"Sorry to say something	 but I just had to because it seems so funny that you actually got caught.

Prior to being diagnosed with normocytic anemia	 I used to (duck out of here now anyone who doesn't want to read about women's issues - just warning ya!) have extremely heavy periods	 for an unusually long number of days.    I was diagnosed with adnemyosis (sp?)    At any rate	 I really did have that uterine condition.    My chronic anemia was chalked up to iron definciency anemia resultant from blood loss.    Made sense to everyone	 even me.So my internist gave me about five bazillion iron shots.    Well first of all	 let me just warn you	 iron shots stain your skin brown.    They are a deep intramuscular injection	 but it doesn't matter	 they leach out into your skin.    This was about seven years ago.    It took three years for the stains	 which resembled bruises that made it seem to anyone I might be dating as though I had some sort of extreme spanking fetish	 to fade to nothing.    (Yes	 my life should be a movie).    Anyway	 it didn't bring my blood count up	 so a year later	 my internist sent me to a hematologist.    She again diagnosed me with iron deficiency anemia.    She put me on IV iron	 to save me from having any more stained thighs and also because it was a more efficient way to supply the iron.    There were several ivs taking up several afternoons during many weeks.    My crit and hemaglobin continued to fall.    They decided to do a partial hysterectomy on me given my uterine condition and in the hopes that with no blood loss my anemia would clear.    They did	 and my crit continued to fall to the point that they had to transfuse me in the hospital.    I continued to drop and they put me on procrit.    They screwed up the hysterectomy and had to open me back up and fix an intestinal block stuck to the suture site of the hysterectomy as well as remove my very hot and infected appendix	 also stuck to the suture site.The procrit relieved (and still does) my anemia.    I was having extreme diarhea(diarrhea)though	 no idea why.    They scheduled an MRI of the stomach (or catscan	 something) and found a tumor	 by chance	 in my liver (actually it was three small tumors	 but the first lab only saw one).    To rule out hepatocellular cancer	 they decided to do a biopsy.    They tried to do a lap biopsy	 but couldn't get far enough into my liver to reach the tumor.    They did however get a liver biopsy in which they found high levels of iron	 due to - you guessed it	 the hematologist who had overdosed me on iron when I didn't really have iron deficiency anemia.    Mind you	 she'd done a bone marrow sample.    In other words	 she had everything she needed to have to have been able to discern that it was not iron deficiency anemia.Now	 back to you.    I swear I related the above not for the telling of it so much as to show you why its important that you understand that these doctors treating us are really limited sometimes in their knowledge.    Even the specialists!    So to answer your question	 the reason you have to be careful about iron is that if it settles in your organs it brings on end organ damage much more quickly and necessitates organs transplants.    This is especially bad when you look at the fact that most of the people who get trasfusions on a regular basis tend to already be pretty sick (hemophiliacs and people with other chronic diseases and disorders) and are less likely to be good organ transplant candidates.This is the reason that they can't just give people who need red blood cells transfusion after transfusion.    Its the very reason they needed a drug like procrit introduced onto the market in the first place	 in order to reduce tranfusions by allowing patients to make their own red blood cells.        There were times when transfusions could not be helped in chronically ill patients	 but new medications have been innovative and have allowed a reduction of transfusions in that community.In my case	 even though I was anemic	 I chose to have my iron overdose treated at my regular doctor's office (talked them into it actually	 they didn't WANT to do it).    I had them bleed me a unit at each visit (once every week or two) and at the same time I upped my procrit (epogen) to compensate for the blood loss.    We did this in increments until all of my blood levels for the various forms of iron were down.    It worked	 and once I wasn't swimming in iron	 my mysterious severe diarrhea went away.    Due to this	 I can only assume it was related to the iron overdose since I've not had it before or since.Anyway PSP	 I'd get referred to a hematologist.    The thing that troubles me a bit is that typically in this Hep C combo treatment	 the anemia that patients experience is caused by hemolysis	 that is	 the early destruction of red blood cells.    That is the typical anemia presentation.    And it makes sense to me with what you've described	 younger blood cells that are dying suddenly.    That sounds exactly like hemolysis	 blood cells that are being destroyed early.    To me	 and I could be extremely wrong about this	 but it seems like that would show up as many baby blood cells	 because the older cells are destroyed early and the body is trying to compensate by constantly making new baby cells.    And that particular scenario has nothing to do with iron deficiency	 as born out by your bloodwork.    The thing is	 since your doctor doesn't really seem to be all that conversant with this topic	 I'd urge you getting in to see a hematologist.    Especially since there should be no problem I can see in putting you back at once a week on procrit now.

post_3841123	post_1934536	my dr said the vaccine virus is not active and it only helps create the antibodies (immunity) and can not trigger the disease that's why many drs say you can get pregnant 3-4 weeks after you had the vaccine (is how long it will take to create the antibodies) and has nothing to do with the time it takes to your body to get rid of the injected virus....	0	post_3297780	0.0	"HiI'm in the same situation.

Instead of killing people with their toxic chemotheraphy and breaking peoples systems down then sending them home to die...its cruel.

Unfortunately	 they often harm your body in the process. There are natural supplements that do a good job of killing cancerous cells	 but don't cause harm to your body. A few supplements do have potential to be toxic to the body	 and should probably just be used in conjunction with a naturopath or alternative doctor. These include cesium	 artemisia	 and B17. In this report you will learn only about completely safe cancer supplements that can be used with no supervision.You may well ask why 	 if a safe and natural product is able to kill cancer	 doesn't your doctor recommend it. Of course	 he probably doesn't know about it	 but even if he did	 he's not likely to use it.It's the nature of the medical/drug industry. Doctors use and recommend drugs that are approved in a process that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. The drug companies only make drugs that can be patented. That way they can sell them for huge mark-ups and have no competition.Lady00712/10/07ALL    Did you know that CAT SCANS are equivalent to 400 chest xrays in Radiation.Did you know that TAXOL kills veins and cripples the area where its been administered....Did you know that HERCEPTIN 2 gives your cardiotoxidity...weakens your HEART...TAXOL combined with HER2 Govt approved only if you take HER2 WITH TAXOL...wow    That sounds like blackmail..Their aim is to kill you one way or the other.Lady00712/10/07ALL    After feeling three lumps in my left breast last december 2006.    They did a mamogram(mammogram)on the breast and you could see the lumps quiet clear.    I then went on to have the biopsy which was via Ultra sound visual system by which you could see the lumps quiet clear again.    These lumps turned out to be grade 3 Cancer	 which had infected two lympnodes.     I then had surgery after nuclear dye had been administered to keep the Doc on track when removing my breast and finding all the supposed infected areas. The surgeon took 15 lympnodes plus the sentinal gland in this operation along with the whole breast removal.    It was the ongoing treatment that had me rather bewildered as to the system of which followed.    I was hit with AC x 4 Cyclophosphamide	 Amend	 Granistron	 Hydrochlorid	 and    Dexamethasone [sent my sugar levels sky high spent week in hospital with that] with maxalon to stabalize my system and diabetic 2 medications.    This was only in the first 4 treatments at 3 week intervals.    Then HER2 combined with TAXOL another 4 treatments...Now I am down onto HER2 on its own...My heart rate first up was 38% next 42% next 47% the next test is pending.    I have decided that if the heart does not come up over 50% next test that my treatment should be stopped.    I need an opinion here?Lady00712/10/07ALL    To my way of thinking my breast should have been hit with radiation to shrink the cancer berfore surgery was administered.    Thus giving a more direct approach to the cancer via the surgeon.    Then when the wound was healed I should have been hit again with radiation.    Then to complete the process of doses of HER2 on its own....In my opinion...too many mistakes have been made on this problem with not enough thought gone into it...I also need an opionion here?Lady00712/11/07ALL    http://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/doctoring1.htmlCORRUPT PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

Even shampoos and conditioners have this stuff in them.    Anyway	 good luck to you and god bless!    Shannon"	0.6169463396072388	4	0.5732728838920593	2	1	1	2	25.0

These are added to lotions	 face care products	 shower gels	 face makeup	 and lord knows what else.    From what I have seen there are several kinds of parabens	 They start out with a different prefix	 such as methelparaben	 etc. but always end with paraben.    You can look for them in the list of ingredients on the back of products.    Since I have learned about this	 I have been reading the labels on my products	 and almost ALL of them have it.

Burts bees (makes lotioin	 hair products	 makeup	 and almost everything) their stuff is all natural and paraben free.    Toms of maine makes good stuff but it is kind of plain for my tastes and the deoderant doesnt work.    A good deoderant is    Sure unscented solid.     There is a product I like called Carol's daughter	 they have lotion	 and body gels and scrubs that I like because they have the same scent in a set.    I just found another product at Sephora    called lavanilla	    it has a natural perfume	 and lotion which actually contain NO parabens and have antioxidents.    It's kind of exspensive though.    I bought it for my daughter and she loves it though.    I emailed Origins and they said    all thier products are paraben free starting this year.     There are tons of other natural products out there too.    I never knew so many existed until I started looking.     An easy way to find things is to look for ""organic""    Most of it is natural without parabens	 but always look at the ingredients in everything just to make sure cause some companies claim to be organic and natural but are full of parabens.    It's not hard to find good stuff if you look.        Good luck guys	 do some reading and looking at labels and you will be surprised at what you find!

I was on 6 rounds of taxol/carbo. which ended Aug 2.    My doctor prescribed Femara for 5 years.    I was on it for 2 or 3 weeks. The side effects were debilitating I could barely walk due to bone/joint pain especially in my lower back.    She switched me to Arimidex. I've been on that 3-4 weeks and have the same side effects only not as severe.    She also put me Celebrex to relieve the pain.    She said she would only keep me on it for only a little while.    That seems to be helping.    I was concerned about taking the Celebrex because of heart trouble associated with arthritis drugs.    The pharmacist told me that Celebrex was not recalled as other drugs have been.    I decided I would rather fight the cancer at this point in time.    From what I have read this seems to be a new treatment for ov/ca.    Has anyone read more about this?    Is one drug better than the other?"	0	post_1941925	0.0	"Hi	Good!

How do you know that the Hep B shot or the series at 2 and 4 months if you only noticed signs at six months? I have a premie in the NICU right now and they want to start his 2 months series and he is only 34 weeks adjusted age. He wouldn't even be out of the womb yet. He was born at 26 weeks. I know I don't feel comfortable giving him a big series of shots when he wouldn't even be getting them under normal circumstances until october. Also I think the Hep B is totally pointless. Hep B is blood transmitted	 meaning you get it much like AIDS. Through tainted blood	 sharing needles	 and unprotected sex. I don't think newborns are gonna be sharing needles and having sex anytime soon do you? The only way they'd be at risk is if their mother had it.Jamie"	1	post_1913952	0.0	congrats havent heard for u in a while	0.1352814882993698	16	0.5277878046035767	13	2	0	13	12.5

post_5066572	post_5065704	"Hello there	First of all you can start by physical activity and healthy diet. There is a special kind of diet that will promote serotonin production.Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.    Thus to produce serotonin	 you need tryptophan.    Tryptophan is an amino acid that you can only obtain by consumption.    Therefore you want to consider eating foods containing sufficient levels of tryptophan to help replenish your serotonin levels each day.    The following is a list:1. Cottage cheese.2. Brown rice.3. Avocados.4. Bananas.5. Walnuts.6. Tomatoes.7. Soy protein.8. Meat.9. Turkey is probably the highest serotonin containing food.    Eat turkey to help increase serotonin levels.Also try Melatonin	 it is a natural hormone produced in the pineal gland	 which is outside of the blood-brain barrier	 acts as an endocrine hormone since it is released into the blood. It helps with sleep and better sleep cycle and i recommend it even more if you withdraw from an anti-depressant. You can try doing some internet research on it it have many advantages.Good luck on the withdrawalM4"	1					1	0.07996700704097748	0	0	999	0	0.0

post_2652600	post_2648985	"Well if the amount of serotonin in your brain is already low why would a drug that helps reuptake like SSRI's make much of a difference? Could this be why people get rebound effects or suddenly a med will stop working because the brain adjusts to the extra serotonin in the brain unable to be absorbed and stops producing enough to even fill those gaps. Much like Alzheimer's patients who take L-dopa ""synthetic dopamine"" they keep having to up the dose because the body will adapt over time. Maybe if you could trick the brain into keep releasing the current amount of serotonin and take synthetic serotonin maybe that could prevent the rebound cycle."	1	post_2649366	0.0	"I know in theory that sounds logical	 but it doesn't work like that.It is the reuptake of Serotonin in the brain that can cause depression	 not the actual level or amount in the brain.For example you could have perfectly normal levels of Serotonin in your brain	 but if the receptors in your brain are performing the reuptake (a kind of absorbsion) of that Serotonin too rapidly then much less Serotonin is left in between the receptors and this inhibits the brains ability to function normally	 which can result in a depressed brain.Not to mention that Serotonin reuptake is not the only contributing factor related to depression. many other neurotransmitting chemicles also play a big part in brain function.

It's this inhibition effect that slowes the reuptake process	 which in turn allows for higher levels of Serotonin to build up in the brain.It's kind of like finding a back door to raising Serotonin levels without introducing a chemical to the system that directly forces a flood of serotonin to be produced artifically.Scientists could easily make a drug that simply and directly raises levels of Serotonin in the brain. The problem with that approach is that to do so would have very serious long term effects on proper brain function.For example	 if I were to inject you with an artifical hormone that your body already produces naturally and I did this for several months	 the end result would be that your body would say	 ""well	 I'm getting plenty so I can shut down making anymore.""Then if the injections were stopped	 there is a good chance your body may not start producing that hormone again.

Could this be why people get rebound effects or suddenly a med will stop working because the brain adjusts to the extra serotonin in the brain unable to be absorbed and stops producing enough to even fill those gaps. Much like Alzheimer's patients who take L-dopa ""synthetic dopamine"" they keep having to up the dose because the body will adapt over time. Maybe if you could trick the brain into keep releasing the current amount of serotonin and take synthetic serotonin maybe that could prevent the rebound cycle."	0.736081600189209	4	0.7119389176368713	2	1	1	2	25.0

post_7064157	post_2648985	Hi I once spoke to the wife of a psychiatrist when I was ill coming off effexor. She told me that erewhen they treat depression they do not know which part of the brain is depressed and what tablets will work it is all just a stab in the dark. In other words it is quite scary because these professionals or so called do not know what they are doing really yet they are giving out chemical altering drugs like smarties. These tablets are highly addictiveand are not easy to get off. So my question is if we went for talking therapy and got it all out of our system would we need these drugs. Also in the long run they make you more depressed and anxious than you already were. They are obviously not working !!!!I remeber being so anxious when i was on venlafluxine i am not saying its a walk in the park but i am not in bed all day and i don't lie in bed worrying.LoveLorraine xx	1	post_7063293	0.0	"I have been off lexapro for about 1 month	 after having been on it for about 12 years.

We thought my son had ADHD due to severe bouts of being hyper	 crying	 picking on sister	 etc.	 but the Dr. doesn't think the stimulant is helping due to him and myself punching	 choking each other even though we had this issue before we went to her. His therapist had mentioned Oppositional Defiant Disorder so I have been reading about it and the other personality disorders	 but the lines of these overlap so much to me. I do have traits of BPD which may be an inherited dysfunction in the limbic system. Anyway	 while reading over those it said may be cause from low serotonin so I'm going to try to get my son to take the Tryptophan (if he will with the ODD-lol)to see if it works.

I am 25 now. I have struggled with it for several years (the unbearable itching and red spots and hives everywhere	 every time I take a shower or go to the pool or work out). It started when I lived in Germany	 and now I live in Louisville	 KY. It has not changed when I moved to KY 10 years ago. I mentioned it to my allergies few years ago	 and she prescribed zyrtec (antihistamine). It helps all my allergies	 including the water allergy. If I take the zyrtec every day	 I do not itch and there are not red spots or hives. Zyrtec does make you quiet a bit tired	 but you can take it before you go to bed."	0.6009697914123535	8	0.5893595218658447	5	2	0	5	25.0

The blotches are basically one lighter and raised pore surrounded by redness. Looks alot like the image you get when you type in aquagenic urticaria into google images from a distance. I'm not sure if this is the same condition however	 because the rash is just slightly itchy	 nothing i can't cope with unlike some of the comments already on here... They go after about 10 minutes...This sounds alot like aquagenic urticaria actually... oh well...If however someone would like to direct me to a better and closer image of the rash than is on google images so I can be sure	 then I would be very thankfull...From Rebecca... all the way from lovely England.."	0.6901506781578064	28	0.4899756610393524	24	3	0	24	10.714285714285714
post_3519607	post_12358	Hi my best friend has me researching this topic because he thinks me may also have    Aquagenic Urticaria. Ever since he was a child everytime water hits his face his cheeks turn bright red and itch alot. the skin on them eventually flakes off and his skin stays bright red for hours. He notices that this occurs with rain tap pool and sea water but not with distilled water. after going to the dermatologist he was told he just has sensitive skin which didnt help him at all .is it possible he has Aquagenic Urticaria?	0	post_3342457	0.0	"From supercoolperson 3 mins later....Another thing I want to mention which is weird ( and adds to my doubt that I have this condition at all) is that there are three patches where the hives/rash used to appear frequently which are now perminently light brown. Almost like these areas of the rash have died and don't flare up anymore. They've been there for a few years and I can't remember what i did	 if anything	 to make them go this way. These patches	 strangely	 seem to always have tiny flakes of dead skin on them	 like this skin is growing and dying faster than the skin around it. I don't mind them	 as long as they don't all go like this or else I'll be covered in light brown patches... anyone else had this?"	0.5671048164367676	29	0.6559557318687439	25	3	0	25	10.344827586206897

I'm wondering about going to the doctors just to 'let them know' or maybe try and remeber to mention it next time I go as it seems it's not nearly as rare as they think! I only searched tonight because they mentioned the name aquagenic urticaria on TV and said how rare it is!Anyway just wanted to let people know thy're not alone and it may go away as i used to get another form of urticaria which was big raised white lumps with red surround which i only came up in when I was ill and too hot- I had it for about 5 years and used it as an indicator of when i was getting sick as it was often the first symptom!"	0.5882510542869568	55	0.5225215554237366	50	4	0	50	7.2727272727272725

I believe this is much more common than publicised	0.42816948890686035	69	0.5092881917953491	63	5	0	63	7.246376811594203

I haven't had an appointment with a doctor yet but I'm positive about it because of all the information that I have read elsewhere	 most especially here. I have break outs when I take a shower	 and haven't tried it on a pool or any bodies of water -- I wanted to be cautious. I also have it when I get in contact with rain	 or even when I eat cold food -- I mostly even vomit when I drink water or anything that's too cold. I wanted to ask	 what would be the best med to control it? What I'm taking	 Celestamine	 does help but I don't take it everyday because it's making me gain weight and interferes my activities by making me drowsy. I just hope this goes away..

This last reaction damned near killed her. then 3 to 4 months ago she began getting a red itchy blotch on her arm ..it grew and grew untill recently the minute water hits her she breaks out into a full red itchy blotch.    We began by removing all drugs	 removed all of her makeup	 soap and the such and found PPG 1 thru 7000 was in every bloody product we looked at. Replaced the products still has the reaction.....doctor and dermatologist say enhhh reaction is just nerves and touchy skin. so in the past week we tried a nice bath in Tea water (tannic acid) tempid temp.. and it dissappeared for 4 days	 she took a shower today and its back with a vengance.

I try to eliminate that but if i have to do it i save it for the very last because where ever the conditioner touches like my back or when i rinse off..is instant horrible long lasting itchy hives that are worse than the others.**Sadly its to the point where just standing in the sun gives them to me	I think that with all this itching my skin is more prone to acne because ANYWHERE i scratch i break out or it turns into a blister.Going on meds for this gives me horrible side effects even over the counter ones.To me its not worth it because it never takes away the symptons so its like more suffering.I just deal with it and try to find more tricks which seems there are very few.I seriously hate this disease and just in the years I've had it its become unbearable that I cannot imagine what it will be like in years to come."	0	post_5607818	0.0	"Hi I'm 26	 my name is Brandon and I live in Sydney Australia.

I have had to quite cross country running and all sports. I am always tired and in pain. AP is just the water caused itching and pain. But I have only been getting worse through the yrs. I have taken about 20 something different meds now and also went through light therapy. Nothing has worked. Although xyzal 5mg everyday seems to help take the edge of the itching.This past week I went to Duke med for an annual 2 month appointment and thats when everything started spinning for me. I am now one of the rarest of the rare. Usually a person has either AP or AU. I have been diagnosed with both. Something that is really never seen.I am a 17 year old	 a senior in High School	 I have dreams of going to Winthrop and teaching art to high schoolers. But all of this is uncertain now. I am so sick I can barley get through my day now. My immune system is almost non existent at this point so I currently have mono	 swollen tonsils	 an enlarged spleen	 severe bone pain	and much more going on	 all on top of having Ap and AU.I am on daily steroids to help get ride of all the infections in my body and then we are going to work on my immune system and then hopefully the AP and AU.I was told that the doctors only concern is my quality of life.

post_7894514	post_12358	"I do not have this	 but I have other allergies (including hives	 but they never last more than an hour and I have no idea what brings them on as they are rare).    However I have 2 ideas for y'all.(1) (You can read about this in the OmegaRX Zone	 by Dr. Baryy Sears	 PhD Lipid science).    Inflammatory cytokines are made in the process of metabolizing non-omega-3 fats (maybe omega-6	 not sure).    The enzymes used to metabolise these fats are the same ones that metabolise omega-3 fats.    If you take a high dose of omega-3 (7-9g/day) it uses up the enzymes so you cannot make inflammatory cytokines.    (So obviously this won't help you if they are already made	 but will prevent more being made - so like other allergy drugs like Flonase	 start it the day before you need it).    It uncrabs my head and I have the worst hayfever my allergist has ever seen.    Also	 I have seen studies showing high dose omega-3 can actually cure (not just treat) psoriasis.    So I think this strategy might be particularly useful with skin allrgies.(2) Someone said their problem arose after a trip to the dentist.    Dentists used to give laughing gas	 which destroys vitamin B12.    I belonged to a forum of people with methylation problems	 and they found that some of their allergies improved when they improved their methylation.    Well	 I also improved my methylation and the only thing that improved was allergy to bug bites (a skin allergy).    So maybe it would help your skin allergy.    You improve methylation by taking active B vitamins and TMG (betaine).    As an example	 an active B supplement is made by Thorne	 I think Pure Encapsulations also makes one (not sure	 I use Thorne).    These include methylcobalamine and adenosylcobalamine (active B12s)	 methylfolate (active folate)	 and P5P (active B6).    I purchase the TMG separately from Soloray in 1g dose.    Others on the forum found that increasing methylation increases the need for potassium	 500mg or more (we take as powder in a drink).    You cannot do this if you have any sort of kidney problem as then you cannot excrete potassium.    I am not a doctor.    But electrolyte problems are serious.    What happens is that many people have a malfunctioning methyl cycle (that's a biochemical cycle) due to either genetics or poor diet (junk food	 overprocessed food).    The methyl cycle enzymes use B vitamins and betaine as cofactors.    Some people genetically have enzymes that cannot hang on to these cofactors	 others are just not getting the vitamin cofactors in their diet.    The methyl cycle makes methyl groups (carried by SAMe	 the universal methyl donor	 throughout the body) and methyls are used to turn on/off chemical reactions.    So w/o enough methyls many reactions that should be ON are left OFF.    When you allow them to be turned ON	 you open up additional biochemical pathways which also need different vitamin cofactors (that's why they are called VITAMINS	 they are required for life!).    So you really should take a good multi vitamin.    But the most serious need will be for more potassium...at least that is what we have found.    But we take many	 many other supplements as well as once your biochemical pathways are working ALL vitamins are needed!    You are on your own if you try this.

post_7951670	post_12358	"I'm a 20-year-old female from Belgium and I've had aquagenic urticaria since I was 12. It just appeared out of the blue one day. It started on my back (the upper part)	 then slowly spread (day by day) to other parts as well. Now everything is ""affected"" after contact with water	 except for my feet	 legs and hands. I used to shower daily at that time - for the last two years I've been trying to shower only 3 to 4 times a week	 only for a few minutes (except when I have to wash my hair).I get these itchy(!) hives when I take a bath	 when I shower	 when I go swimming in a swimming pool or in the ocean	 when I shower	 etc. Even my own sweat triggers a reaction. Whether the water is cold or hot makes no difference. They usually appear after about 5 to 10 minutes	 and it takes about one or two hours for them to disappear again.I went to the dermatologist and she gave me an ointment with cortisone which I had to use on the hives when they would appear. The ointment made the hives disappear faster	 but it did not prevent them. The dermatologist then submitted me to some allergy tests but nothing came out (except for an allergy to cobalt and nickel). So she concluded that it must be aquagenic urticaria	 and told me that nothing could be done about it. She mentioned that it was possible to take other	 more advanced	 tests	 but that these were very expensive and that they rarely produced results.She gave me a prescription for antihistaminica (Zyrtec / Ceterizine)	 which prevents the hives when taken daily. This works for me	 but I only use it when I go swimming in public or something like that - I don't like taking too much pills	 and certainly not if I feel tired after taking them.As for my skin in general: it's always rather dry and sensitive. Some moisturizing creams even give me allergic reactions (other than the aquagenic urticaria).

Lactose intolerance is a side effect of gluten so it STILL could be a gluten celiac problem...there's really only a few basic ones..like fructose intolerance/gluten/lactose... so I would just eliminate (it's hard..) but eliminate gluten and dairy from your diet for a good month or two.    You might as well..that's what i'm doing right now..dairy has helped me big time..before I was a heavy dairy milk drinker..also you could just completely empty yourself out like prepping for a colonoscopy.. if you're still nauseated being empty of all food/waste I would think that would suggest something else other than just the typical IBS junk... something else to try.

That was years ago	 when I was much younger than you are now.I have also had eczema that was one giant blister on the heel of either hand when it started.    The blister was about an inch in diameter.    I knew not to pop the things	 but they eventually did this on their own.    It's rather difficult for this to not happen	 since the heel of the hand is on the palm side of the hand.    Even if I tried to avoid certain things	 it was impossible for me to keep my hands completely still.    Oh	 and by the way	 those blisters were so big that they interferred when I had to write and sign my name.I discovered that I am allergic to petroleum based products.    Guess what your commercial detergents are made of?    And	 they're things that the doctor mentioned above to avoid.Getting back to food sensitivities.    Check it out.    Most of us have food sensitivities and allergies that we're unaware of.    Do some research about the basic elimination diet.    It will really help you narrow down which foods you could be sensitive to.    I just read an excellent article on mercola.com that you really should investigate.    You don't have to subscribe to read this great article either.    Go to mercola.com to find the latest newsletter.    Find the article called ""How Yeast Wreaks Havoc on Your Life (Health) and How to Address it"".    This is vital information for just about everyone I know.    It was mentioned that up to 75% of women have this Candidas and don't know about it.    It affects men	 too.    Candidas is linked to many common illnesses	 including food sensitivities and allergies.    Untreated Candidas leads to serious illnesses.    Conventional medicine doesn't really know how to deal with Candidas.    Check this out	 you'll be glad that you did.There are many more natural personal care products that will certainly help with the hand eczema	 because your hands won't be exposed to the irritants that cause the problem nearly so much.    Trust me	 changing your shampoo and conditioner will really help.    Earth Science and Jason both make natural fragrance free shampoos and conditioners.    They are not harsh and drying	 which really helps your hands	 too.Changing your laundry products will also help.    If you have eczema on your hands	 chances are the rest of your skin is affected by the products you use	 too.    Seventh Generation makes a natural laundry soap.    There are a couple of others that you can find at your natural grocery stores.A very big one to change	 though	 is your dish liquid.    Stop using the commercial petroleum based detergents.    They aren't even soap!    Seventh Generation is an excellent dish liquid.    Don't worry about the lack of suds compared to your commercial products.    Your dishes will still be plenty clean enough.    There is a reason for this with all natural products	 including your shampoos.    They don't contain the well-known carcinogen sodium lauryl (laureth) sulfate (SLS) or any of its derivatives.    Manufacturers add this to their products to create an unnatural lather that we're all programmed to believe is normal and necessary.    It's not.    SLS is harsh on the skin and very drying and should be avoided for this reason alone.    I found an excellent type of hand soap that is made from vegetable glycerin (there's your fat) and doesn't irritate the skin.    It has a wide variety of choices.    I use the one that has no added fragrances and is just called ""natural""	 because I don't do well with any scents	 including the natural ones.    The company is called Sappo Hill.    The soap cakes are round.    I found that candle bases for pillar candles work great as soap dishes for this differently shaped soap.    I found the one I'm using now that someone was getting rid of.    It's made of pottery	 too.    They have two varieties of soaps made with different grades of oatmeal.    This	 too	 could prove helpful to you	 because oatmeal is supposed to be soothing for the skin.    I don't use the oatmeal ones	 because I'm gluten intolerant.    Whatever you use on your skin (largest organ for your body) still enters your blood stream.    But	 the finely milled oatmeal variety might work well for your eczema	 too.    The natural one is the most neutral one	 though	 that I have found.    You'll love the price of the Sappo Hill soaps	 too.    They are so affordable that there is no excuse for even the sickest and most sensitive person to go without bathing and remaining clean.Watch out	 because SLS is also in your toothpaste.    There are natural toothpastes that don't contain any SLS.    You have to watch out even with the natural ones and read the ingredients to make sure they don't sneak SLS into an otherwise acceptable product.    One brand that doesn't have this is called Waleda.    It's a company in Germany.    They even have a variety of toothpaste that has a natural pink color	 due to the herb that makes it that color.Another big help is to actually go without using ANY soap that isn't absolutely necessary.    Well	 this works out great for my dry skin and hair.    You can actually get in the shower and massage your scalp without using any shampoo or conditioner at all.    This will actually help even if your hair is oily by nature.    You're still removing the excess oil and dirt	 but without torturing your skin.    This is really great for people with dry scalp and hair	 because it will stimulate the scalp into producing the oils necessary for the skin and hair	 because you're not stripping your scalp and hair either.Again	 this isn't your hands	 but you're keeping your hands out of harm's way by doing these change overs.    I speak from experience.Also	 find a good body lotion or cream that you can use on your hands	 too	 that isn't petroleum based.The cleansers that the doctor was talking about that have no detergent or soap base can also be found at the natural markets.    Earth Science makes an excellent line of affordable products.    They have cleansers and moisturizers for the face that are even fragrance free.    I have Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) and I'm not experiencing problems with this line.    The same may not be true of every person with MCS for every product.    I learned that the hard way when I had a severe reaction to face moisturizing cream made by Jason that burned my skin.    It's natural	 but it's not fragrance free.    It clearly has herbs in it that I am very allergic to.    On the other hand	 I know someone with MCS who can use this one without any problems whatsoever.

post_7981201	post_2153469	"Hi H 28. This is an immune system issue. When pregnant some components of your immune system are down regulated (or modulated in a particular way) otherwise the immune system would attack the embryo.    This modulation is the reason why women with a variety of immune related issues have reduced symptoms or are symptom free during pregnancy.The issue for you however is that your immune system is activated unnecessarily at times. The symptoms will rise and fall according to underlying immune system cycling and intersection with allergens. Step 1. Get the Physical things right. Diet - avoid the antagonists such as ""bad foods"" chemicals etc	 get your teeth checked by an integrative dental practitioner - reason is bad teeth	 dental implants and root canalled teeth enable dental bacteria to get into the blood stream and produce endo-toxins which will cause a variety of inflammatory disorders. If you have a root canalled tooth or teeth I would get them out - your choice. Next physical step is to eliminate fungal infections as a possible issue	 they also produce toxins which can be disastrous and cause reactive inflammation - strict diet is a first step but add good quality probiotics - essential. Then you must do exercise - weight bearing is better because it increases stem cell activity and this also regulates immune activity - brings about homeostasis - balance to the immune system. See ""Crohn's disease Osiris clinical study"" on web - stem cells can have dramatic effects on inflammation.http://www.osiris.com/prod_crohns.phpStep 2 is the Mental - being calm and being positively occupied may need some focus. There are many things one could do here from relaxation programs to meditation to transformative courses. Different things work better for different people - but getting to a calm state is important. Add in a positive psychology lesson - see books - Flourish and the Optimistic Child by Martin Seligman. People who are flourishing add to their vibrancy and good health.Think about your immune system as an adaptive system that plastic and can change - you can change it over time just like your brain is adaptive and if injured it can recover - see the Brain that Changes Itself by Norman Doige. It takes time but your immune system can be modified to be less reactive but you have to get rid of antagonists first and then activate your normal body functions and de-stress mentally and then be positively engaged in creating things - your life and your children's lives etc etc.Back to immune cycles - these are just starting to be understood by the medical research community. Like the menstrual cycle there is an immune cycle - but it switches on and off over 6 to 8 days not the 28 to 30 days of the menstrual cycle. if you are having symptoms of skin and other irritation/inflammation then the Inflammation will mainly occur as it switches on and build its activity over about 3 days. eg with T cells (part of your immune system) they are activated and then after about 3 days they are down regulated by Treg cells and then about 3 days later the T cells turn on again. You can get an idea of where the cycle is by accurate temperature measures every day using an inner ear electronic digital thermometer (the other way is to get CRP measures from your blood which is much more complicated and needs your doctor to organise). Plot the temperatures and join the dots and you will see the wave of the cycle. Best to do every 12 hours. You might then make sure you have a very relaxing day when the cycle is at the bottom of activity - this is when the temperature is lowest and the immune cells as being activated. eg have a hot soothing bath and have a calm ""look after yourself"" day. Weight bearing exercise is better done before the bottom of the cycle so that the stem cells are activated the day before the T cells are activated.This probably sounds a little weird	 but it's worth a try. As we find out more about the immune system cycles it will have a dramatic effect on many illnesses like cancer	 auto immune diseases and infectious diseases. Check the web for ""immune cycles Ashdown"" and ""immune cycles 7 day Huggins""."	1	post_6537541	1.0	"Although I commented some time ago	 it is worth reiterating that you may or may not test positive for gluten intolerance but still find yourself to be gluten intolerant.

These drug combinations shrank the tumors of nearly half the women (45%) treated. In contrast	 less than one third (29%) of those women who received chemotherapy alone had a similar response. When Herceptin was added to the chemotherapy	 it boosted survival by an average of 5 months compared to chemotherapy alone.A small number of the women taking the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin had significant heart problems	 including congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump effectively. Adriamycin was blamed for most of this effect. Herceptin on its own rarely causes heart damage. But the two drugs given together resulted in more heart damage than expected. For this reason	 the combination of Herceptin and Adriamycin is no longer recommended.Navelbine chemotherapy combined with Herceptin has also been studied recently in clinical trials.----------------------------------------------Serious heart side effectsResearch News:Preliminary results from the HERA Trial: Herceptin Taken Less Frequently at Higher Doses Does Not Increase Risk of Heart Damage Less commonly	 Herceptin can damage the heart's ability to pump blood effectively.

Studies have shown that this combination causes only slightly more mild heart damage than Herceptin alone. Women in clinical trials who are receiving Herceptin plus Taxol are being watched very closely for this effect.Testing your heart before and during Herceptin treatmentBefore starting Herceptin therapy	 you should have an echocardiogram or a MUGA scan to check how well your heart is functioning.An echocardiogram uses sound waves to take detailed pictures of the heart as it pumps blood.

post_1929047	post_1905230	"I have 3 children.    One has pdd (pervaisive developmental disorder) which is an asd or autism spectrum disorder.    My oldest child shows the same symptoms only more exaggerated.    No one ever told me this but...contact a developmental pediatrician.    They are the only people that can properly diagnose an asd.    mary t did mention some good resources but most of the drs. she mentioned are not trained throughly in developmental delays.    I never knew until 6 months ago that this is where my oldest child should have been evaluated rather than a psychiatrist.    Do it now as the wait is typically 6 yo 8 months to be seen.    If you are right and it is an asd...early intervention works wonders.    Without the early interventions my 3 yr. old would be worse off and if my 8 yr. old gotten early intervention she would be better off.    Yes what you describe can be symptoms of an asd but that by far does not mean your child has it.    Please make an appointment with a developemental pediatrician.    I would also recommend that you contact your local school district and inform them that you would like an evaluation for your child's delays as they should generally have more communicative skills at 14 months than you describe.    Testing and evaluations for such are paid for by the school district in NY and I think it is the same in every state.    The people that do the testing are trained to spot such things and you are always involved in the process.    Some kids are just late talker but you will never know if it is that or something more serious unless you check it out.Doing these things is a right royal pain some times but better to do it and find out you are wrong than not do it and find out years from now that you really should have followed up on your concern.    Don't ever let anyone tell you that you are being paranoid or overly concerned.    I got that a lot.On the gluten free diet:    there are no conclusive results on that but yes some children do better on a gluten free diet.    Symptoms can also be eased by ""going green"" or eliminating artificial ingredients as much as possible from your child's diet.    This I have found to be helpful from personal experience.One final suggestion:    get hooked up with a support group online or in your local community for parent's of asd children.    I have found simply talking to other parents helps.    Sometimes you get great ideas and sometimes you give them.autism spectrum disorders are autism	 aspergers syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder.    There are tons of great books you can read to get more info.    If you like I can provide you with a few great titles that I have found to be a huge help for me.As a side note:    autism or asd IS NOT always rain man.    Too many people don't know this.    You never have to tell anyone about that label if you don't want to	 your child isn't doomed to a life in a facility	 and autistic children have just as bright a future as any other child.    Many adults with more mild asds would never be noticed as different when there was early intervention.Please excuse my rambling (passionate about the topic i guess)."	1	post_1927429	0.0	"I watched actresses Jenny McCarthy and Holly Robinson discuss autism last night on Larry King Live.

post_1972117	post_1905230	"Ok	 I read a book a few months ago about the gluten and MS.    It is not the gluten	 it is the uncontrolable yeast which is your body that builds up and destroys various things in your body.    The gluten is something that feeds yeast.    Also	 any kind of sugar.    And they think also vaccines.    The MS diet that I am on is no yeast	gluten	sugar	or dairy.    I starting during an attack.    Within 3 days	 I came out of it.    I felt the best in years.    I have been on it now for 4 months.    You also have to take an antifungal.    I use an organic one called Primal Defense.    I have had great results.    There are so many things you cannot eat though.    You have to avoid any foods basically that cause inflammation.    This is the same diet Jenny put her son on except the website she gave out does not follow the same regiment.    I met someone who's son had Crohns disease and went on the diet and is now in remission and    does not have to take medication anymore.    It is something to try.    There is no possible way can it hurt you."	1	post_1929047	1.0	"I have 3 children.    One has pdd (pervaisive developmental disorder) which is an asd or autism spectrum disorder.    My oldest child shows the same symptoms only more exaggerated.    No one ever told me this but...contact a developmental pediatrician.    They are the only people that can properly diagnose an asd.    mary t did mention some good resources but most of the drs. she mentioned are not trained throughly in developmental delays.    I never knew until 6 months ago that this is where my oldest child should have been evaluated rather than a psychiatrist.    Do it now as the wait is typically 6 yo 8 months to be seen.    If you are right and it is an asd...early intervention works wonders.    Without the early interventions my 3 yr. old would be worse off and if my 8 yr. old gotten early intervention she would be better off.    Yes what you describe can be symptoms of an asd but that by far does not mean your child has it.    Please make an appointment with a developemental pediatrician.    I would also recommend that you contact your local school district and inform them that you would like an evaluation for your child's delays as they should generally have more communicative skills at 14 months than you describe.    Testing and evaluations for such are paid for by the school district in NY and I think it is the same in every state.    The people that do the testing are trained to spot such things and you are always involved in the process.    Some kids are just late talker but you will never know if it is that or something more serious unless you check it out.Doing these things is a right royal pain some times but better to do it and find out you are wrong than not do it and find out years from now that you really should have followed up on your concern.    Don't ever let anyone tell you that you are being paranoid or overly concerned.    I got that a lot.On the gluten free diet:    there are no conclusive results on that but yes some children do better on a gluten free diet.    Symptoms can also be eased by ""going green"" or eliminating artificial ingredients as much as possible from your child's diet.    This I have found to be helpful from personal experience.One final suggestion:    get hooked up with a support group online or in your local community for parent's of asd children.    I have found simply talking to other parents helps.    Sometimes you get great ideas and sometimes you give them.autism spectrum disorders are autism	 aspergers syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder.    There are tons of great books you can read to get more info.    If you like I can provide you with a few great titles that I have found to be a huge help for me.As a side note:    autism or asd IS NOT always rain man.    Too many people don't know this.    You never have to tell anyone about that label if you don't want to	 your child isn't doomed to a life in a facility	 and autistic children have just as bright a future as any other child.    Many adults with more mild asds would never be noticed as different when there was early intervention.Please excuse my rambling (passionate about the topic i guess)."	0.4714047312736511	6	0.45141491293907166	3	2	1	3	33.33333333333333
post_2084566	post_1905230	"Thank you so much for your question- I will address your concerns to the best of my ability although you must realize that I am unable to examine your child and obtain a history and thus my response should be considered as informative rather than as a diagnosis.    Let me begin by giving you some background.As some of the others on the forum have alluded to	 autism is part of a spectrum of disorders referred to in the medical community as the pervasive developmental disorders.    This group of developmental problems include Autism	 Rett's Syndrome	 Asperger Syndrome	 childhood disintegration disorder	 and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified; Rett's and Autism are on the more severe end of the spectrum with Asperger's generally causing more mild developmental impairment.    A few years back	 there was quite a bit of commotion in the media regarding linkage of autism with vaccination; this connection has yet to be substantiated within the literature and there are mere select cases that have been reported but no clear association between the two.When evaluating a child for developmental delay	 there are various areas that are evaluated	 particularly social and language skills.    When looking at language	 things to consider are whether the child has been delayed on reaching language milestones 	 and	 if delayed	 is there evidence of regression.    With respect to social interaction	 does your child make eye contact with others? Interact with others? Engage in play with others?    Sometimes abnormalities in social impairment become more apparent once the child enters daycare years.     As you have also alluded to in your question	 children with one of the pervasive developmental disorders may demonstrate repetitive behaviors referred to as stereotypies- arm-flapping is one of the more common ones.The fact that your child interacts with you is encouraging and this hand-flapping that you are noticing may be simple baby play.    To give you an idea of normal development	 at    about 12-14 months	 toddlers will generally be able to say ""mama	"" ""dada	"" ""no.""    Based on what you have told me	 I wouldn't be too worried about your child at this point but I would make sure to follow regularly with your pediatrician.    Your pediatrician would be the best resource for evaluating the developmental progress of your child and can likewise to refer you to developmental specialists for further evaluation should there be concerns for developmental delay.I know that this information is limited	 but I hope it is helpful.    Thank you	 again	 for your question and i wish you the best of luck."	0	post_1972117	1.0	"Ok	 I read a book a few months ago about the gluten and MS.    It is not the gluten	 it is the uncontrolable yeast which is your body that builds up and destroys various things in your body.    The gluten is something that feeds yeast.    Also	 any kind of sugar.    And they think also vaccines.    The MS diet that I am on is no yeast	gluten	sugar	or dairy.    I starting during an attack.    Within 3 days	 I came out of it.    I felt the best in years.    I have been on it now for 4 months.    You also have to take an antifungal.    I use an organic one called Primal Defense.    I have had great results.

post_1922965	post_1920533	I was just about to say exactly what casey's mom just said the CDC is now NOT saying that the shots do not cause Autism.    They are also not saying there is a link - they are just acknowledging that they are looking into it further.    Before they would not.    The ingrediant that was the trigger for autism (believed by many moms) was Thermisol (spell?) and that has been taken out of the vaccine.    I asked my doctor about all of these and he told me that the ingrediant was taken out but he still does not think there is a link but he did say he gets this questions ALL THE TIME.    It is a shot that they get when they are around 2 years old - I am going to worry about it more then.	0	post_1922951	0.0	"The CDC recently made a announcement that they could not disprove vaccinations were not a contribution to the cause of austim.

post_1572866	post_1558918	"Missy	Here's my two cents worth. My OBGYN allowed me to have either tums or maalox while pregnant. I have a hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease. It was really severe during pregnancy and I would get terrible pain. Of course always check with your doctor before trying anything at home	 but I found it helpful to prop up on several pillows instead of lying more flat on the bed. Try to eat your last meal or snack at least 2-3 hrs. before bedtime	 and stay away from caffeine. Sometimes ginger-ale and/or a saltine cracker would help me. Contrary to popular belief milk does not help heartburn	 it actually increases acid production in the stomach. Of course you and your baby need adequate milk	 calcium and magnesium but if your doctor allows itskim milk is less likely to affect you. If you are worried about the aluminum	 ex strength Tums does not list it in their ingredients. I am fairly certain though that Maalox does have it.Hope this helps but do check it out with your doctor.

Try to eat your last meal or snack at least 2-3 hrs. before bedtime	 and stay away from caffeine. Sometimes ginger-ale and/or a saltine cracker would help me. Contrary to popular belief milk does not help heartburn	 it actually increases acid production in the stomach. Of course you and your baby need adequate milk	 calcium and magnesium but if your doctor allows itskim milk is less likely to affect you. If you are worried about the aluminum	 ex strength Tums does not list it in their ingredients. I am fairly certain though that Maalox does have it.Hope this helps but do check it out with your doctor. Good luck and hope you have a healthy baby!"	0.5431822538375854	10	0.6379938721656799	6	3	0	6	30.0
